      <td>Chemical Cartography with LAMOST and Gaia Reveal Azimuthal and Spiral Structure in the Galactic Disk</td>
      <td>Chemical Cartography, or mapping, of our Galaxy has the potential to fully\ntransform our view of its structure and formation. In this work, we use\nchemical cartography to explore the metallicity distribution of OBAF-type disk\nstars from the LAMOST survey and a complementary sample of disk giant stars\nfrom Gaia DR3. We use these samples to constrain the radial and vertical\nmetallicity gradients across the Galactic disk. We also explore whether there\nare detectable azimuthal variations in the metallicity distribution on top of\nthe radial gradient. For the OBAF-type star sample from LAMOST, we find a\nradial metallicity gradient of $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$R $\sim -0.078 \pm 0.001$\ndex/kpc in the plane of the disk and a vertical metallicity gradient of\n$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$Z $\sim -0.15 \pm 0.01$ dex/kpc in the solar\nneighborhood. The radial gradient becomes shallower with increasing vertical\nheight while the vertical gradient becomes shallower with increasing\nGalactocentric radius, consistent with other studies. We also find detectable\nspatially-dependent azimuthal variations on top of the radial metallicity\ngradient at the level of $\sim$0.10 dex. Interestingly, the azimuthal\nvariations appear be close to the Galactic spiral arms in one dataset (Gaia\nDR3) but not the other (LAMOST). These results suggest that there is azimuthal\nstructure in the Galactic metallicity distribution and that in some cases it is\nco-located with spiral arms.</td>

      <td>Multimass modelling of Milky Way globular clusters -- I. Implications on their stellar initial mass function above 1 M$_{\odot}$</td>
      <td>The distribution of stars and stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars,\nblack holes) within globular clusters holds clues about their formation and\nlong-term evolution, with important implications for their initial mass\nfunction (IMF) and the formation of black hole mergers. In this work, we\npresent best-fitting multimass models for 37 Milky Way globular clusters, which\nwere inferred from various datasets, including proper motions from Gaia EDR3\nand HST, line-of-sight velocities from ground-based spectroscopy and deep\nstellar mass functions from HST. We use metallicity dependent stellar evolution\nrecipes to obtain present-day mass functions of stars and remnants from the\nIMF. By dynamically probing the present-day mass function of all objects in a\ncluster, including the mass distribution of remnants, these models allow us to\nexplore in detail the stellar (initial) mass functions of a large sample of\nMilky Way GCs. We show that, while the low-mass mass function slopes are\nstrongly dependent on the dynamical age of the clusters, the high-mass slope\n($\alpha_3; m > 1 M_\odot$) is not, indicating that the mass function in this\nregime has generally been less affected by dynamical mass loss. Examination of\nthis high-mass mass function slope suggests an IMF in this mass regime\nconsistent with a Salpeter IMF is required to reproduce the observations. This\nhigh-mass IMF is incompatible with a top-heavy IMF, as has been proposed\nrecently. Finally, based on multimass model fits to our sample of Milky Way\nGCs, no significant correlation is found between the high-mass IMF slope and\ncluster metallicity.</td>

      <td>Peeking beneath the precision floor -- II. Probing the chemo-dynamical histories of the potential globular cluster siblings, NGC 288 and NGC 362</td>
      <td>The assembly history of the Milky Way (MW) is a rapidly evolving subject,\nwith numerous small accretion events and at least one major merger proposed in\nthe MW's history. Accreted alongside these dwarf galaxies are globular clusters\n(GCs), which act as spatially coherent remnants of these past events. Using\nhigh precision differential abundance measurements from our recently published\nstudy, we investigate the likelihood that the MW clusters NGC 362 and NGC 288\nare galactic siblings, accreted as part of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE)\nmerger. To do this, we compare the two GCs at the 0.01 dex level for 20+\nelements for the first time. Strong similarities are found, with the two\nshowing chemical similarity on the same order as those seen between the three\nLMC GCs, NGC 1786, NGC 2210 and NGC 2257. However, when comparing GC abundances\ndirectly to GSE stars, marked differences are observed. NGC 362 shows good\nagreement with GSE stars in the ratio of Eu to Mg and Si, as well as a clear\ndominance in the r- compared to the s-process, while NGC 288 exhibits only a\nslight r-process dominance. When fitting the two GC abundances with a GSE-like\ngalactic chemical evolution model, NGC 362 shows agreement with both the model\npredictions and GSE abundance ratios (considering Si, Ni, Ba and Eu) at the\nsame metallicity. This is not the case for NGC 288. We propose that the two are\neither not galactic siblings, or GSE was chemically inhomogeneous enough to\nbirth two similar, but not identical clusters with distinct chemistry relative\nto constituent stars.</td>

      <td>Globular Cluster UVIT Legacy Survey (GlobULeS) $-$ II. Evolutionary status of hot stars in M3 and M13</td>
      <td>We present a far-ultraviolet (FUV) study of hot stellar populations in the\nsecond parameter pair globular clusters (GCs) M3 and M13, as a part of the\nGlobular cluster UVIT Legacy Survey program (GlobULeS). We use observations\nmade with F148W and F169M filters of the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT)\nonboard {\em AstroSat} along with ground-based data (UBVRI filters), {\em\nHubble Space Telescope (HST)} GC catalogue, and {\em Gaia} EDR3 catalogue.\nBased on the FUV-optical colour-magnitude diagrams, we classify the sources\ninto the horizontal branch (HB) stars, post-HB stars, and hot white dwarfs\n(WDs) in both the GCs. The comparison of synthetic and observed colours of the\nobserved HB stars suggests that the mass-loss at the red giant branch (RGB) and\nHe spread in both clusters have a simultaneous effect on the different HB\ndistributions detected in M3 and M13, such that, HB stars of M13 require a\nlarger spread in He (${\rm 0.247-0.310}$) than those of M3 (${\rm Y=\n0.252-0.266}$). The evolutionary status of HB stars, post-HB stars, and WDs are\nstudied using SED fit parameters and theoretical evolutionary tracks on the H-R\ndiagram. We found that the observed post-HB stars have evolved from zero-age HB\n(ZAHB) stars of the mass range $0.48-0.55$ \Msun\ in M3 and M13. We detect 24\nWD candidates in each cluster having ${\rm \log(L_{bol}/L_\odot)}$ in the range\n$-0.8$ to $+0.6$ and ${\rm \log(T_{eff}/K)}$ in the range of 4.2 to 5.0.\nPlacing the WDs on the H-R diagram and comparing them with models suggest that\nM13 has a population of low-mass WDs, probably originating from binary\nevolution.</td>

      <td>First observational evidence of a relation between globular clusters' internal rotation and stellar masses</td>
      <td>Several observational studies have shown that many Galactic globular clusters\n(GCs) are characterised by internal rotation. Theoretical studies of the\ndynamical evolution of rotating clusters have predicted that, during their\nlong-term evolution, these stellar systems should develop a dependence of the\nrotational velocity around the cluster's centre on the mass of stars, with the\ninternal rotation increasing for more massive stars. In this paper we present\nthe first observational evidence of the predicted rotation-mass trend. In our\ninvestigation, we exploited the $\mathit{Gaia}$ Data Release 3 catalogue of\nthree GCs: NGC 104 (47 Tuc), NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen) and NGC 5904 (M 5). We\nfound clear evidence of a cluster rotation-mass relation in 47 Tuc and M 5,\nwhile in $\omega$ Cen, the dynamically youngest system among the three clusters\nstudied here, no such trend was detected.</td>

      <td>Atmospheric parameters and kinematic information for the M giants stars from LAMOST DR9</td>
      <td>A catalog of more than 43,000 M giant stars has been selected by Li et al.\nfrom the ninth data release of LAMOST. Using the data-driven method SLAM, we\nobtain the stellar parameters (Teff, logg, [M/H], [$\alpha$/M]) for all the M\ngiant stars with uncertainties of 57 K, 0.25 dex, 0.16 dex and 0.06 dex at SNR\n> 100, respectively. With those stellar parameters, we constrain the absolute\nmagnitude in K-band, which brings distance with relative uncertainties around\n25% statistically. Radial velocities are also calculated by applying cross\ncorrelation on the spectra between 8000 A $\AA$ and 8950 A $\AA$ with synthetic\nspectra from ATLAS9, which covers the Ca II triplet. Comparison between our\nradial velocities and those from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia DR3 shows that our radial\nvelocities have a system offset and dispersion around 1 and 4.6 km s$^{-1}$,\nrespectively. With the distances and radial velocities combining with the\nastrometric data from Gaia DR3, we calculate the full 6D position and velocity\ninformation, which are able to be used for further chemo-dynamic studies on the\ndisk and substructures in the halo, especially the Sagittarius Stream.</td>

      <td>VINTERGATAN-GM: The cosmological imprints of early mergers on Milky-Way-mass galaxies</td>
      <td>We present a new suite of cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical ($\approx 20\,\n\mathrm{pc}$ spatial resolution) simulations of Milky-Way mass galaxies to\nstudy how a varying mass ratio for a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) progenitor\nimpacts the $z=0$ chemodynamics of halo stars. Using the genetic modification\napproach, we create five cosmological histories for a Milky-Way-mass dark\nmatter halo ($M_{200} \approx 10^{12} \, M_\mathrm{\odot}$), incrementally\nincreasing the stellar mass ratio of a $z\approx2$ merger from 1:25 to 1:2,\nwhile fixing the galaxy's final dynamical, stellar mass and large-scale\nenvironment. We find markedly different morphologies at $z=0$ following this\nchange in early history, with a growing merger resulting in increasingly\ncompact and bulge-dominated galaxies. Despite this structural diversity, all\ngalaxies show a radially-biased population of inner halo stars like the\nMilky-Way's GSE which, surprisingly, has a similar magnitude, age, $\rm [Fe/H]$\nand $\rm [\alpha/Fe]$ distribution whether the $z\approx2$ merger is more minor\nor major. This arises because a smaller ex-situ population at $z\approx2$ is\ncompensated by a larger population formed in an earlier merger-driven starburst\nwhose contribution to the GES can grow dynamically over time, with both\npopulations strongly overlapping in the $\rm [Fe/H]-\rm [\alpha/Fe]$ plane. Our\nstudy demonstrates that multiple high-redshift histories can lead to similar\n$z=0$ chemodynamical features in the halo, highlighting the need for additional\nconstraints to distinguish them, and the importance of considering the full\nspectrum of progenitors when interpreting $z=0$ data to reconstruct our\nGalaxy's past.</td>

      <td>The vertex coordinates of the Galaxy's stellar systems according to the Gaia DR3 catalogue</td>
      <td>We present the results of determining the coordinates of the vertices of\nvarious stellar systems, the centroids of which are located in the Galactic\nplane. To do this, the positions, parallaxes, proper motions, and radial\nvelocities of red giants and subgiants contained in the $Gaia$~DR3 catalogue\nhave been used. When determining the components of the deformation velocity\ntensors in local coordinate systems, we found the coordinates of the vertices\nof the stellar systems under study. It turned out that there is a complex\ndependence of vertex deviations $l_{xy}$ in Galactocentric cylindrical ($R,\n\theta$) and Galactic rectangular ($X,Y$) coordinates. Based on the approach\nproposed in this paper, heliocentric distances to vertices have been determined\nfor the first time. The results obtained show that in addition to the fact that\nthe angular coordinates of the Galactic center and the vertices of stellar\nsystems do not coincide, their heliocentric distances do not coincide as well.\nThis presumably indicates that there are structures in the Galaxy that\nnoticeably affect its axisymmetry.</td>

      <td>Chasing the impact of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger on the formation of the Milky Way thick disc</td>
      <td>We employ our Bayesian Machine Learning framework BINGO (Bayesian INference\nfor Galactic archaeOlogy) to obtain high-quality stellar age estimates for\n68,360 red giant and red clump stars present in the 17th data release of the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey, the APOGEE-2 high-resolution spectroscopic survey. By\nexamining the denoised age-metallicity relationship of the Galactic disc stars,\nwe identify a drop in metallicity with an increase in [Mg/Fe] at an early\nepoch, followed by a chemical enrichment episode with increasing [Fe/H] and\ndecreasing [Mg/Fe]. This result is congruent with the chemical evolution\ninduced by an early-epoch gas-rich merger identified in the Milky Way-like\nzoom-in cosmological simulation Auriga. In the initial phase of the merger of\nAuriga 18 there is a drop in metallicity due to the merger diluting the metal\ncontent and an increase in the [Mg/Fe] of the primary galaxy. Our findings\nsuggest that the last massive merger of our Galaxy, the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus,\nwas likely a significant gas-rich merger and induced a starburst, contributing\nto the chemical enrichment and building of the metal-rich part of the thick\ndisc at an early epoch.</td>

      <td>Accelerated phase-mixing in the stellar halo due to a rotating bar</td>
      <td>In a galaxy merger, the stars tidally stripped from the satellite and\naccreted onto the host galaxy undergo phase mixing and form finely-grained\nstructures in the phase space. However, these fragile structures may be\ndestroyed in the subsequent galaxy evolution, in particular, by a rotating bar\nthat appears well after the merger is completed. In this work, we investigate\nthe survivability of phase-space structures in the presence of a bar. We find\nthat a bar with amplitude and pattern speed similar to those of the Milky Way\nwould blur and destroy a substantial amount of the substructure that consists\nof particles with pericentre radii comparable to the bar length. While this\nappears to be in tension with the recent discovery of phase-space chevrons in\n\textit{Gaia} DR3 data, the most prominent chevrons in our simulations can\nstill be recovered when applying the same analysis procedure as in\nobservations. Moreover, the smoothing effect is less pronounced in the\npopulation of stars whose angular momenta have the opposite sign to the bar\npattern speed.</td>

      <td>The distribution of globular clusters in kinematic spaces does not trace the accretion history of the host galaxy</td>
      <td>Reconstructing how all the stellar components of the Galaxy formed and\nassembled over time, by studying the properties of the stars which make it, is\nthe aim of Galactic archeology. In these last years, thanks to the launch of\nthe ESA Gaia astrometric mission, and the development of many spectroscopic\nsurveys, we are for the first time in the position to delve into the layers of\nthe past of our galaxy. Globular clusters (GCs) play a fundamental role in this\nresearch field since they are among the oldest stellar systems in the Milky Way\n(MW) and so bear witness of its entire past. In the recent years, there have\nbeen several attempts to constrain the nature of clusters (accreted or formed\nin the MW itself) through the analysis of kinematic spaces and to reconstruct\nfrom this the properties of the accretions events experienced by the MW through\ntime. This work aims to test a widely-used assumption about the clustering of\nthe accreted populations of GCs in the integrals of motions space. We analyze a\nset of dissipation-less N-body simulations that reproduce the accretion of one\nor two satellites with their GC population on a MW-type galaxy. Our results\ndemonstrate that a significant overlap between accreted and\n"kinematically-heated" in-situ GCs is expected in kinematic spaces, for mergers\nwith mass ratios of 1:10. In contrast with standard assumptions made in the\nliterature so far, we find that accreted GCs do not show dynamical coherence,\nthat is they do not cluster in kinematic spaces. In addition, GCs can also be\nfound in regions dominated by stars which have a different origin (i.e.\ndifferent progenitor). This casts doubt on the association between GCs and\nfield stars that is generally made in the literature to assign them to a common\norigin. Our findings severely question the recovered accretion history of the\nMW based on the phase-space clustering of the GC population.</td>

      <td>Swing Amplification and the Gaia Phase Spirals</td>
      <td>We explore the interplay between in-plane and vertical dynamics in stellar\ndiscs within the framework of the shearing box approximation. Julian and Toomre\nused the shearing sheet to show that leading density waves are amplified as\nthey swing into a trailing ones. We extend their formalism into the dimension\nperpendicular to the disc and obtain explicit solutions for the response of a\ndisc to an impulsive, external excitation. An excitation that is is symmetric\nabout the mid plane produces a density/breathing wave as well as two-armed\nphase spirals in the vertical phase space plane. On the other hand, an\nexcitation that is antisymmetric about the mid plane leads to a bending wave\nand single-armed phase spirals. In either case, self-gravity plays a crucial\nrole in driving the evolution of the disturbance and determining the amplitude\nand pitch angle of the ensuing spirals. We also show that when the disc is\nexcited by a co-rotating cloud, it develops stationary phase spirals in the\nwake of the cloud. The results call into question simple kinematic arguments\nthat have been used to determine the age of the phase spirals seen in the Gaia\nsurvey</td>

      <td>Substructure, supernovae, and a time-resolved star formation history for Upper Scorpius</td>
      <td>The improved astrometry precision of Gaia-eDR3 allows us to perform a\ndetailed study of the Upper Scorpius OB association and revisit its spatial,\nkinematic, and age substructure. We achieve this by combining clustering\ntechniques and complementing with age estimations based on Gaia photometry. Our\ncensus retrieves 3661 candidate members for Upper Scorpius with contamination\n$\sim$9\%. We also extract an astrometrically clean sample of 3004 sources with\ncontamination $\sim$6\%. We show that Upper Scorpius can be divided into at\nleast 3 main kinematic groups. We systematically investigate and characterize\nthe Upper Scorpius' internal structure, revealing that at least $\sim 34\%$ of\nits stellar populations are contained in 7 spatial substructures, with well\ndefined boundaries, kinematics and relative ages, with suggested names: $\pi$\nScorpii (20 $^{\pm2}_{\pm1}$ Myr), $\alpha$ Scorpii (14$^{\pm2}_{\pm1}$ Myr),\n$\delta$ Scorpii (9$^{\pm2}_{\pm1}$ Myr), $\beta$ Scorpii (8$^{\pm1}_{\pm1}$\nMyr), $\omega$ Scorpii (8$^{\pm1}_{\pm1}$ Myr), $\nu$ Scorpii\n(7$^{\pm1}_{\pm1}$ Myr), after their brightest member, and the well known\n$\rho$ Ophiuchi (4$^{\pm1}_{\pm1}$ Myr). We find a clear correlation in (1)\ndensity-age, providing an empirical expansion law to be tested in other\nassociations, and (2) tangential velocity-age, providing constrains on the\ndynamics of these substructures and the position of potential past triggering\nevents. We estimate the time at which 4 potential supernovae events occurred in\nUpper Scorpius. Based on these findings, we tie together previous work on the\nregion and suggest a star formation history with unprecedented temporal\nresolution.</td>

      <td>Dynamical age of the Tucana-Horologium young stellar association</td>
      <td>The Tucana-Horologium association is one of the closest young stellar groups\nto the Sun and despite the close proximity its age is still debated in the\nliterature. We take advantage of the state-of-the-art astrometry delivered by\nthe third data release of the Gaia space mission combined with precise radial\nvelocity measurements obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy to investigate\nthe dynamical age of the association. We perform an extensive traceback\nanalysis using a combination of different samples of cluster members, metrics\nto evaluate the minimum size of the association in the past and models for the\ngalactic potential to integrate the stellar orbits back in time. The dynamical\nage of $38.5^{+1.6}_{-8.0}$ Myr that we derive in this paper is consistent with\nthe various age estimates obtained from isochrone fitting in the literature\n(30-50 Myr) and reconciles, for the first time, the dynamical age of the\nTucana-Horologium association with the age obtained from lithium depletion\n($\sim40$ Myr). Our results are independent from stellar models and represent\none more step towards constructing a self-consistent age scale for the young\nstellar groups of the Solar neighbourhood based on the 3D space motion of the\nstars.</td>

We use new CCD\nUBV(RI)KC photometry, which was combined with Gaia EDR3 photometric/astrometric\ndata, to derive the astrophysical parameters with two independent methods - one\nof them the fitCMD algorithm. Furthermore, we provide among others estimates of\nthe mass and mass function, the cluster structure, derive the cluster orbits,\nand discuss the cluster dynamics. All objects belong to the older open cluster\npopulation (1-7Gyr), are in an advanced dynamical stage with signs of mass\nsegregation, and are located close to the solar circle, but show a large range\nin respect of radii, member stars or observed cluster mass (100-2000 Msolar).\nFor the three younger objects we were also able to provide photometric\nmetallicity estimates, which confirms their status as clusters with a roughly\nsolar metallicity. The most outstanding object is clearly NGC 6791, a very old\ncluster with a high metallicity at a distance of about 4.5 kpc from the Sun. We\nestimate a probable radial migration by about 7 kpc, resulting in a birth\nposition close to the Galactic center.</td>

This, together with their brightness\nin the infrared, makes them powerful probes of the formation and evolution of\nhighly-extincted or distant parts of the Local Group. Here we utilise the Gaia\nDR3 catalogue of long-period variable candidates to calibrate the period-age\nrelation of the Mira variables. Dynamical models are fitted to the O-rich Mira\nvariable population across the extended solar neighbourhood and then the\nresulting solar neighbourhood period-kinematic relations are compared to\nexternal calibrations of the age-kinematic relations to derive a Mira variable\nperiod-age relation of\n$\tau\approx(6.9\pm0.3)\,\mathrm{Gyr}(1+\tanh((330\,\mathrm{d}-P)/(400\pm90)\mathrm{d})$.\nOur results compare well with previous calibrations using smaller datasets as\nwell as the period-age properties of Local Group cluster members. This\ncalibration opens the possibility of accurately characterising the star\nformation and the impact of different evolutionary processes throughout the\nLocal Group.</td>

We\nreconstruct the proper motion, radial velocity, distance, on-sky track and\nstellar density along the stream with spline models. The stream has a total\nluminosity of $M_V=-8.2$ and metallicity of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-1.9$, similar to\nclassical Milky Way (MW) satellites like Draco. The stream shows drastic\nchanges in its physical width varying from 200 pc to 1 kpc, but a constant line\nof sight velocity dispersion of 5 km/ss. Despite the large apparent variation\nin the stellar number density along the stream, the flow rate of stars along\nthe stream is remarkably constant. We model the 6-D stream track by a\nLagrange-point stripping method with a flexible MW potential in the presence of\na moving extended Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This allows us to constrain the\nmass profile of the MW within the distance range 15.6 < r < 55.5 kpc, with the\nbest measured enclosed mass of $(2.85\pm 0.1)\times 10^{11}\,M_\odot$ within\n32.4 kpc. Our stream measurements are highly sensitive to the LMC mass profile\nwith the most precise measurement of its enclosed mass made at 32.8 kpc,\n$(7.02\pm 0.9)\times10^{10}\, {\rm M}_\odot$. We also detect that the LMC dark\nmatter halo extends to at least 53 kpc. The fitting of the OC stream allows us\nto constrain the past LMC trajectory and the degree of dynamical friction it\nexperienced. We demonstrate that the stars in the OC stream show large energy\nand angular momentum spreads caused by LMC perturbation.</td>

      <td>Determining Satellite Infall Times Using Machine Learning</td>
      <td>A key unknown of the Milky Way (MW) satellites is their orbital history, and,\nin particular, the time they were accreted onto the MW system since it marks\nthe point where they experience a multitude of environmental processes. We\npresent a new methodology for determining infall times, namely using a neural\nnetwork (NN) algorithm. The NN is trained on MW-analogues in the EAGLE\nhydrodynamical simulation to predict if a dwarf galaxy is at first infall or a\nbacksplash galaxy and to infer its infall time. The resulting NN predicts with\n85\% accuracy if a galaxy currently outside the virial radius is a backsplash\nsatellite and determines the infall times with a typical 68\% confidence\ninterval of 4.4 Gyrs. Applying the NN to MW dwarfs with Gaia EDR3 proper\nmotions, we find that all of the dwarfs within 300 kpc had been inside the\nGalactic halo. The overall MW satellite accretion rate agrees well with the\ntheoretical prediction except for late times when the MW shows a second peak at\na lookback time of 1.5 Gyrs corresponding to the infall of the LMC and its\nsatellites. We also find that the quenching times for ultrafaint dwarfs show no\nsignificant correlation with infall time and thus supporting the hypothesis\nthat they were quenched during reionisation. In contrast, dwarfs with stellar\nmasses above $10^5~M_\odot$ are found to be consistent with environmental\nquenching inside the Galactic halo, with star-formation ceasing on average at\n$0.5^{+0.9}_{-1.2}$ Gyrs after infall.</td>

      <td>Chemodynamical Ages of Small-Scale Kinematic Structures of the Galactic Disc in the Solar Neighborhood from ~250,000 K and M Dwarfs</td>
      <td>We combine photometric metallicities with astrometry from Gaia DR3 to examine\nthe chemodynamic structure of ~250,000 K dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood (SN).\nIn kinematics, we observe ridges/clumps of "kinematic groups", like studies of\nmore massive main-sequence stars. Here we note clear differences in both\nmetallicity and vertical velocity as compared to the surrounding regions in\nvelocity space and hypothesize this is due to differences in mean age. To test\nthis, we develop a method to estimate the age distribution of sub-populations\nof stars. In this method, we use GALAH data to define probability distributions\nof W vs. [M/H] in age bins of 2 Gyr and determine optimal age distributions as\nthe best fit weighted sum of these distributions. This process is then\nvalidated using the GALAH subset. We estimate the probable age distribution for\nregions in the kinematic plane, where we find significant sub-structure that is\ncorrelated with the kinematic groups. Most notably, we find an age gradient\nacross the Hercules streams that is correlated with birth radius. Finally, we\nexamine the bending and breathing modes as a function of age. From this, we\nobserve potential hints of an increase in the bending amplitude with age, which\nwill require further analysis in order to confirm it. This is one of the first\nstudies to examine these chemodynamics in the SN using primarily low-mass stars\nand we hope these findings can better constrain dynamical models of the Milky\nWay due to the increase in resolution the sample size provides.</td>

We define a\npseudo-length for the Galactic bar, named $R_{Freq}$, based on the maximal\nextent of trapped bar orbits. We find the $R_{Freq}$ measured from orbits is\nconsistent with the $R_{Freq}$ of the assumed potential only when the length of\nthe bar and pattern speed of said potential is similar to the model from which\nthe initial phase-space coordinates of the orbits are derived. Therefore, one\ncan measure the model's or the Milky Way's bar length from 6D phase-space\ncoordinates by determining which assumed potential leads to a self-consistent\nmeasured $R_{Freq}$. When we apply this method to $\approx$210,000 stars in\nAPOGEE DR17 and $Gaia$ eDR3 data, we find a consistent result only for\npotential models with a dynamical bar length of $\approx$3.5 kpc. We find the\nMilky Way's trapped bar orbits extend out to only $\approx$3.5 kpc, but there\nis also an overdensity of stars at the end of the bar out to 4.8 kpc which\ncould be related to an attached spiral arm. We also find that the measured\norbital structure of the bar is strongly dependent on the properties of the\nassumed potential.</td>

      <td>The kinematics of about 2000 classical Cepheids of the Milky Way with data\nfrom Gaia\,EDR3 catalog has been studied. For some of these stars, there are\nline-of-sight velocities. On the basis of the nonlinear rotation model, the\nparameters of the rotation curve of the Galaxy were determined. The circular\nlinear rotation velocity of the near-solar neighborhood around the Galaxy\ncenter was $V_0=236\pm 3$~km s$^{-1}$ for the assumed Sun's galactocentric\ndistance $R_0=8.1\pm0.1$~kpc. Analysis of residual velocities of Cepheids based\non the linear Ogorodnikov-Milne model showed the presence of the following\nsignificantly different from zero gradients: $\partial U/\partial x,$ $\partial\nU/\partial z,$ $\partial V/\partial x,$ $\partial V/\partial z$ and $\partial\nW/\partial x,$ which behaves differently depending on the selection radius. The\nmost interesting is the gradient $\partial W/\partial x\sim-0.5\pm0.1$~km\ns$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ (positive rotation of this star system around the galactic\naxis $y$, $\Omega_y$) since the velocities $W$ are free of galactic rotation.\nHere we have an indirect influence of various effects leading to a perturbation\nof the vertical velocities of the galactic disk stars. Based on a simpler\nmodel, a more accurate estimate of this rotation is obtained,\n$\Omega_y=0.51\pm0.07$~km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$.</td>

The second model assumes that DM is confined to the\nGalactic disk, following the idea that the observed density of gas in the\nGalaxy is related to the presence of more massive DM disk (DMD), similar to the\nobserved correlation between DM and gas in other galaxies. The third model only\nuses the known stellar mass components and is based on the Modified Newton\nDynamics (MOND) theory. Our results indicate that the DMD model is comparable\nin accuracy to the NFW and MOND models and fits the data better at large radii\nwhere the rotation curve declines but has the largest errors. For the NFW model\nwe obtain a virial mass $M_{vir}= (6.5 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{11} \; M_\odot$ with\nconcentration parameter $c=14.5$, that is lower than what is typically\nreported. In the DMD case we find that the MW mass is $M_d = (1.6 \pm 0.5)\n\times 10^{11} \; M_\odot$ with a disk's characteristic radius of $R_d=17$ kpc.</td>

Here, we present\na catalogue of $\sim$47 million halo stars selected independent of parallax and\nline-of-sight velocities, using a combination of Gaia DR3 proper motion and\nphotometry by means of their reduced proper motion. We select high tangential\nvelocity (halo) main sequence stars and fit distances to them using their\nsimple colour-absolute-magnitude relation. This sample reaches out to $\sim$21\nkpc with a median distance of $6.6$ kpc thereby probing much further out than\nwould be possible using reliable Gaia parallaxes. The typical uncertainty in\ntheir distances is $0.57_{-0.26}^{+0.56}$ kpc. Using the colour range\n$0.45<(G_0-G_\mathrm{RP,0})<0.715$ where the main sequence is narrower, gives\nan even better accuracy down to $0.39_{-0.12}^{+0.18}$ kpc in distance. The\nmedian velocity uncertainty for stars within this colour range is 15.5 km/s.\nThe distribution of these sources in the sky, together with their tangential\ncomponent velocities, are very well-suited to study retrograde substructures.\nWe explore the selection of two complex retrograde streams: GD-1 and Jhelum.\nFor these streams, we resolve the gaps, wiggles and density breaks reported in\nthe literature more clearly. We also illustrate the effect of the kinematic\nselection bias towards high proper motion stars and incompleteness at larger\ndistances due to Gaia's scanning law. These examples showcase how the full RPM\ncatalogue made available here can help us paint a more detailed picture of the\nbuild-up of the Milky Way halo.</td>

Additionally, we find that patterns in velocity field overlap\nspatially with models for Spiral arms in the Galaxy. Our simulations show that\nphase-mixing of disrupting spiral arms can generate such residuals in the\nvelocity field, where the radial component is dominant, just as in real data.\nWe also find that with time evolution both the amplitude and physical scale of\nthe residual motion decrease.</td>

      <td>We present the e-TidalGCs Project which aims at modeling and predicting the\nextra-tidal features surrounding all Galactic globular clusters for which 6D\nphase space information, masses and sizes are available (currently 159 globular\nclusters). We focus the analysis and presentation of the results on the\ndistribution of extra-tidal material on the sky, and on the different\nstructures found at different heliocentric distances. We emphasize the wide\nvariety of morphologies found: beyond the canonical tidal tails, our models\nreveal that the extra-tidal features generated by globular clusters take a wide\nvariety of shapes, from thin and elongated shapes, to thick, and complex\nhalo-like structures. We also compare some of the most well studied stellar\nstreams found around Galactic globular clusters to our model predictions,\nnamely those associated to the clusters NGC 3201, NGC 4590, NGC 5466 and Pal 5.\nAdditionally, we investigate how the distribution and extension in the sky of\nthe simulated streams vary with the Galactic potential by making use of three\ndifferent models, containing or not a central spheroid, or a stellar bar.\nOverall, our models predict that the mass lost by the current globular cluster\npopulation in the field from the last 5 Gyrs is between\n$0.3-2.1\times10^{7}M_{\odot}$, an amount comparable between 7-55 % of current\nmass. Most of this lost mass is found in the inner Galaxy, with the half-mass\nradius of this population being between 4-6 kpc. The outputs of the simulations\nwill be publicly available, at a time when the ESA Gaia mission and\ncomplementary spectroscopic surveys are delivering exquisite data to which\nthese models can be compared.</td>

      <td>The accretion history of the Milky Way. I. How it shapes globular clusters and dwarf galaxies</td>
      <td>Halo inhabitants are individual stars, stellar streams, star and globular\nclusters, and dwarf galaxies. Here we compare the two last categories that\ninclude objects of similar stellar mass, which are often studied as\nself-dynamical equilibrium systems. We discover that the half-light radius of\nglobular clusters depends on their orbital pericenter and total energy, and\nthat Milky Way (MW) tides may explain the observed correlation. We also suggest\nthat the accretion epoch of stellar systems in the MW halo can be calibrated by\nthe total orbital energy, and that such a relation is due to both the mass\ngrowth of the MW and dynamical friction affecting mostly satellites with\nnumerous orbits. This calibration starts from the bulge, to Kraken, Gaia\nSausage Enceladus, Sagittarius stellar systems, and finally to the new coming\ndwarfs, either or not linked to the vast-polar structure. The most eccentric\nglobular clusters and dwarfs have their half-light radius scaling as the\ninverse of their binding energy, and this over more than two decades. This\nmeans that earlier arriving satellites are smaller due to the tidal effects of\nthe MW. Therefore, most halo inhabitants appear to have their structural\nparameters shaped by MW tides and also by ram-pressure for the most recent\narrivals, the dwarf galaxies. The correlations found in this study can be used\nas tools to further investigate the origin of globular clusters and dwarfs, as\nwell as the assembly history of our Galaxy.</td>

      <td>On the degree of stochastic asymmetry in the tidal tails of star clusters</td>
      <td>Context: Tidal tails of star clusters are commonly understood to be populated\nsymmetrically. Recently, the analysis of Gaia data revealed large asymmetries\nbetween the leading and trailing tidal tail arms of the four open star clusters\nHyades, Praesepe, Coma Berenices and NGC 752. Aims: As the evaporation of stars\nfrom star clusters into the tidal tails is a stochastic process, the degree of\nstochastic asymmetry is quantified in this work. Methods: For each star cluster\n1000 configurations of test particles are integrated in the combined potential\nof a Plummer sphere and the Galactic tidal field over the life time of the\nparticular star cluster. For each of the four star clusters the distribution\nfunction of the stochastic asymmetry is determined and compared with the\nobserved asymmetry. Results: The probabilities for a stochastic origin of the\nobserved asymmetry of the four star clusters are: Praesepe ~1.7 sigma, Coma\nBerenices ~2.4 sigma, Hyades ~6.7 sigma, NGC 752 ~1.6 sigma. Conclusions: In\nthe case of Praesepe, Coma Berenices and NGC 752 the observed asymmetry can be\ninterpreted as a stochastic evaporation event. However, for the formation of\nthe asymmetric tidal tails of the Hyades additional dynamical processes beyond\na pure statistical evaporation effect are required.</td>

      <td>We present the first far-UV (FUV) imaging results of the intermediate-age\nGalactic open cluster NGC 2818 that has a Planetary nebula (PN) within the\nfield using images taken from the Ultra-violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) aboard\nAstroSat. We identify cluster members by combining UVIT-detected sources with\nGaia EDR3 data. We detect four bright and hot blue straggler stars (BSSs) and\ntwo yellow straggler stars (YSSs) based on their location in the optical and\nFUV-optical color-magnitude diagrams. Based on the parameters estimated using\nSpectral Energy Distribution (SED), we infer that BSSs are either collisional\nproducts or might have undetectable white dwarf (WD) companions. Our\nphotometric analysis of YSSs confirms their binarity, consistent with the\nspectroscopic results. We find YSSs to be formed through a mass-transfer\nscenario and the hot components are likely to be A-type subdwarfs. A comparison\nof the radial velocity (RV), Gaia EDR3 proper motion of the PN with the\ncluster, and reddening towards the PN and the cluster does not rule out the\nmembership of the PN. Comparing the central star's position with theoretical\npAGB models suggest that it has already entered the WD cooling phase, and its\nmass is deduced to be ~0.66Msun. The corresponding progenitor mass turns out to\nbe ~2.1Msun, comparable to the turn-off mass of the cluster, implying that the\nprogenitor could have formed in the cluster. We suggest that the NGC 2818 might\nbe one of the few known clusters to host a PN, providing a unique opportunity\nto test stellar evolution models.</td>

Disk and halo orbits are separated by using the criteria defined in\nCarollo et al. (2021). We found 26 stars with $[Fe/H] \leq -2.5$ possessing\ndisk kinematics, of which 14 are extremely metal-poor. At these metallicities,\nthe number of stars with disk kinematics is three times its retrograde\ncounterpart. In the same range of metallicity we also identified 37 halo stars\nmost tightly bound to the gravitational potential of the progenitor halo. The\norigin of these stars are investigated by comparing the observational results\nwith simulated galaxies from the Aquarius Project and the IllustrisTNG\nsimulations. We found two mechanisms of formation of VMP stars with disk\nkinematics: accretion from early satellites (which is dominant), and {\it\nin-situ} formation. These stars are very old, with ages > 12.5 Gyr ($z$ > 5),\nand they are $\alpha$-enriched. Accretion and {\it in-situ} formation are also\nfound for the retrograde counterparts with being accretion also the dominant\nmode. Contributing accreted satellites have stellar masses in the range\n$[10^{6}-10^9]$ M_sun, and are very gas-rich. The most bound halo stars are the\noldest detected with a median age of ~ 13.3 Gyr ($z$ ~ 11), and\n$\alpha$-enriched. Our finding clearly show that very old, very metal-poor\nstars store important information on the first stages of assembly of our Galaxy\nand its halo.</td>

      <td>Local stellar motions are expected, and have been shown, to include\nsignatures of the Galaxy's past dynamical evolution. These are typically\ndivided into the disc, which shows the dynamical effects of spiral arms and the\nbar, and the stellar halo, with structures thought to be debris from past\nmergers. We use Gaia Data Release 3 to select large samples of these\npopulations without limiting them to sources with radial velocities. We apply a\npenalised maximum likelihood method to these samples to determine the full 3D\nvelocity distribution in Cartesian $(U, V, W)$ or spherical $(v_r, v_\phi,\nv_\theta)$ coordinates. We find that the disc population is dominated by four\nmoving groups and also detect a new moving group at $(U, V) = (-10, -15)$ km\ns$^{-1}$ which we call MMH-0. For the stellar halo, we isolate the accreted\ncomponent with cuts in transverse velocity and the colour-magnitude diagram. In\nthis component we find several known structures believed to be caused by past\nmergers, particularly one around $(v_r, v_\phi, v_\theta) = (-150, -300, -100)$\nkm s$^{-1}$ appears more prominent than previously claimed. Furthermore we also\nidentify two new structures near $(v_r, v_\phi, v_\theta) = (225, 25, 325)$ km\ns$^{-1}$ and $(0, 150, -125)$ km s$^{-1}$ which we refer to as MMH-1 and MMH-2\nrespectively. These results give new insights into local stellar motions and\nshows the potential of using samples that are not limited to stars with\nmeasured line-of-sight velocities, which is key to providing large samples of\nstars, necessary for future studies.</td>

Their slope has the\ndimension of inverse time, with the simplest interpretation being the inverse\nage of the Snail. Here, we devise and fit a simple model in which the spiral\nstarts as a lopsided perturbation from steady state, that winds up into the\npresent-day morphology. The winding occurs because the vertical frequency\ndecreases with vertical action. We use data from stars in Gaia EDR3 that have\nmeasured radial velocities, pruned by simple distance and photometric selection\nfunctions. We divide the data into boxels of dynamical invariants (radial\naction, angular momentum); our model fits the data well in many of the boxels.\nThe model parameters have physical interpretations: one, $A$, is a perturbation\namplitude, and one, $t$, is interpretable in the simplest models as the time\nsince the event that caused the Snail. We find trends relating the strength and\nage to angular momentum: (i) the amplitude $A$ is small at low angular momentum\n($<1\,600\mathrm{\,kpc\,km\,s}^{-1}$ or guiding-centre radius $< 7.3\,$kpc),\nand over a factor of three larger, with strong variations, in the outer disc;\n(ii) there is no single well-defined perturbation time, with $t$ varying\nbetween 0.2 and 0.6 Gyr. Residuals between the data and the model display\nsystematic trends, implying that the data call for more complex models.</td>

We find that the distributions of radial action for both the\nthin and thick disks can be approximately described by pseudo-isothermal\ndistributions, which give a statistical measurement for the temperature of the\ndisk as indicated by the mean radial action of the star sample. Estimations of\nthe scale heights in different radial action ranges for these pseudo-isothermal\ndistributions of the disks seem to show fixed relationships between radial\naction $J_R$ and scale height $h$. We describe these relationships with a\ntwo-parameter function of $h = \sqrt{J_R /a} + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are free\nparameters. When testing with a three-parameter function of\n$h=\sqrt[\alpha]{J_R/a}+b$, we find that this two-parameter function describes\nthe thin disk well, but we note the function should be used with care for the\nthick disk. When comparing the best-fit relationships between the inner and\nouter disk for both of the thin and thick disks, we find that the relationships\nare nearly the same for the thin disks but are different for the thick disks.\nThe inner thick disk shows a nearly flattened relationship, while the outer\nthick disk presents a gradually increasing relationship. This work highlights\nan alternative way to unveil the heating history of the disks by investigating\nthe relationship between scale height and radial action, as these relationships\nencode the formation and heating history of the Galactic disks.</td>

This led to the estimation of millions of individual\nchemical abundances and allows us to chemically map the Milky Way. Among the\npublished GSP-Spec abundances, three heavy-elements produced by\nneutron-captures in stellar interiors can be found: Ce, Zr and Nd. We use a\nsample of about 30,000 LTE Ce abundances, selected after applying different\ncombinations of GSP-Spec flags. Thanks to the Gaia DR3 astrometric data and\nradial velocities, we explore the cerium content in the Milky Way and, in\nparticular, in its halo and disc components. The high quality of the Ce\nGSP-Spec abundances is quantified thanks to literature comparisons. We found a\nrather flat [Ce/Fe] versus [M/H] trend. We also found a flat radial gradient in\nthe disc derived from field stars and, independently, from about 50 open\nclusters, in agreement with previous studies. The [Ce/Fe] vertical gradient has\nalso been estimated. We also report an increasing [Ce/Ca] vs [Ca/H] in the\ndisc, illustrating the late contribution of AGB with respect to SN II. Our\ncerium abundances in the disc, including the young massive population, are well\nreproduced by a new three-infall chemical evolution model. Among the halo\npopulation, the M 4 globular cluster is found to be enriched in cerium.\nMoreover, eleven stars with cerium abundances belonging to the Thamnos, Helmi\nStream and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus accreted systems were identified from\nchemo-dynamical diagnostics. We found that the Helmi Stream could be slightly\nunderabundant in cerium, compared to the two other systems.

We present a new\nchemical evolution model for the Galactic disc components (high- and low-\n$\alpha$ sequence stars) designed to reproduce the new abundance ratios\nprovided by the GSP-spec module for the Gaia DR3 and also constrained by the\ndetailed star formation histories for both the thick and thin disc stars\ninferred from previous Gaia releases.

Additionally, Gaia DR3 highlighted the presence of young (massive)\nlow-$\alpha$ disc stars which show evidence of a recent chemical impoverishment\nin several elements. Hence, in this study, we compare Gaia DR3 chemical\nabundances with the predictions of a three-infall chemical evolution model for\nthe high- and low-$\alpha$ components. The proposed three-infall chemical\nevolution model nicely reproduces the main features of the abundance ratio\n[X/Fe] versus [M/H] (X=Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, $\alpha$) of Gaia DR3 stars in different\nage bins for the considered $\alpha$ elements. Moreover, the most recent gas\ninfall - which started $\sim$ 2.7 Gyr ago - allows us to predict well the Gaia\nDR3 young population which has experienced a recent chemical impoverishment.</td>

      <td>Gaia-IGRINS synergy: Orbits of Newly Identified Milky Way Star Clusters</td>
      <td>The recent exquisite Gaia astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity (RV)\nmeasurements resulted in a substantial advancement for the determination of the\norbits for old star clusters, including the oldest Milky Way globular clusters\n(MW GCs). The main goal of this paper is to use the Gaia DR3 and the VVVX\nmeasurements to obtain the orbits for nearly a dozen new Galactic GC candidates\nthat have been poorly studied or previously unexplored. We use the Gaia DR3 and\nVVVX databases to identify bonafide members of the Galactic GC candidates:\nVVV-CL160, Patchick122, Patchick125, Patchick126, Kronberger99, Kronberger119,\nKronberger143, ESO92-18, ESO93-08, Gaia2, and Ferrero54. The relevant mean\ncluster physical parameters are derived (distances, Galactic coordinates,\nproper motions, RVs). We measure accurate mean RVs for the GCs VVV-CL160 and\nPatchick126, using observations acquired at the Gemini-South telescope with the\nIGRINS high-resolution spectrograph. Orbits for each cluster are then computed\nusing the GravPot16 model, assuming typical Galactic bar pattern speeds. We\nreconstruct the orbits for these clusters for the first time. These include\nstar clusters with retrograde and prograde orbital motions, both in the\nGalactic bulge and disk. Orbital properties, such as the mean time-variations\nof perigalactic and apogalactic distances, eccentricities, vertical excursions\nfrom the Galactic plane, and Z-components of the angular momentum are obtained\nfor our sample. Our main conclusion is that, based on the orbital parameters,\nPatchick125 and Patchick126 are genuine MW bulge/halo GCs; Ferrero54, Gaia2 and\nPatchick122 are MW disk GCs. The orbits of Kronberger99, Kronberger119,\nKronberger143, ESO92-18, and ESO93-08 are more consistent with old MW disk open\nclusters. VVV-CL160 falls very close to the Galactic centre, but reaches larger\ndistances beyond the Sun, thus its origin is still unclear.</td>

      <td>We combine the kinematics of 159 globular clusters (GCs) provided by the Gaia\nEarly Data Release 3 (EDR3) with other observational data to classify the GCs,\nand to estimate the mass of the Milky Way (MW). We use the age-metallicity\nrelation, integrals of motion, action space and the GC orbits to identify the\nGCs as either formed in-situ (Bulge and Disk) or ex situ (via accretion). We\nfind that $45.3\%$ have formed in situ, $38.4\%$ may be related to known merger\nevents: Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, the Helmi\nstreams, the Sequoia galaxy, and the Kraken galaxy. We also further identify\nthree new sub-structures associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus. The\nremaining $16.3\%$ of GCs are unrelated to the known mergers and thought to be\nfrom small accretion events. We select 46 GCs which have radii $8.0<r<37.3$ kpc\nand obtain the anisotropy parameter $\beta=0.315_{-0.049}^{+0.055}$, which is\nlower than the recent result using the sample of GCs in Gaia Data Release 2,\nbut still in agreement with it by considering the error bar. By using the same\nsample, we obtain the MW mass inside the outermost GC as $M(<37.3\nkpc)=0.423_{-0.02}^{+0.02}\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$, and the corresponding\n$M_{200}=1.11_{-0.18}^{+0.25}\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$. The estimated mass is\nconsistent with the results in many recent studies. We also find that the\nestimated $\beta$ and mass depend on the selected sample of GCs. However, it is\ndifficult to determine whether a GC fully traces the potential of the MW.</td>

      <td>Detailed analysis of the variable star population in the globular cluster NGC 7006</td>
      <td>A five year CCD photometric \emph{VI} time-series of NGC 7006 is employed to\nperform a detailed analysis of the known population of variable stars. In the\nprocess we have corrected inconsistent classifications, sky coordinates and\nfound ten new cluster member variables. An independent reddening estimate with\na value $E(B-V)=0.08\pm0.05$ is made. Using Fourier decompositions of RR Lyrae\nlight curves and well established calibrations, the cluster mean metallicity\nand distance [Fe/H]$_{\rm ZW}= -1.53\pm0.15$ and $41.2\pm1.4$ kpc are estimated\nbased on an extended sample of cluster member RRab stars. Using the $Gaia$-DR3\ndata we performed an extensive membership analysis which leads to a clean\nColour-Magnitude diagram, and hence to the identification of variables that are\nlikely field stars, and to considerations on the variables distribution in the\nHorizontal Branch (HB). A double mode RR Lyrae and three CW star are discussed.\nThe origin of CW stars from precursors in the blue tail of the HB with very\nthin ($\sim 0.06 \pm 0.01 M_{\odot}$) envelopes is argued. Our models indicate\nthat the Main Sequence predecessor of RR Lyrae stars had a mass of 0.82-0.85\n$M_{\odot}$ and lost about 25-35\% of its mass during the red giant branch\nevents before settling in the HB some 12-13.5 Gyrs later.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Probing the lithium abundances in old metal-rich dwarf stars in the Solar vicinity</td>
      <td>We test a scenario in which radial migration could affect the Li abundance\npattern of dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood. This may confirm that the Li\nabundance in these stars can not serve as a probe for the Li abundance in the\ninterstellar medium. We use the high-quality data (including Li abundances)\nfrom the 6th internal Data Release of the Gaia-ESO survey. In this sample, we\ngroup stars by similarity in chemical abundances via hierarchical clustering.\nOur analysis treats both measured Li abundances and upper limits. The Li\nenvelope of the previously identified radially migrated stars is well below the\nbenchmark meteoritic value (<3.26 dex); the star with the highest detected\nabundance has A(Li) = 2.76 dex. This confirms the previous trends observed for\nold dwarf stars (median ages $\sim$ 8 Gyr), where Li decreases for\n[Fe/H]$\gtrsim$0. This result acts as supporting evidence that the abundance of\nLi measured in the upper envelope of old dwarf stars should not be considered a\nproxy for the interstellar medium Li. Our scenario also indicates that the\nstellar yields for [M/H]>0 should not be decreased, as recently proposed in the\nliterature. Our study backs the recent studies that claimed that old dwarfs on\nthe hot side of the dip are efficient probes of the ISM abundance of Li,\nprovided atomic diffusion does not lower significantly the initial Li abundance\nin the atmospheres of metal-rich objects.</td>

These fibre systems feed a\ndual-beam spectrograph covering the wavelength range 366$-$959\,nm at\n$R\sim5000$, or two shorter ranges at $R\sim20\,000$. After summarising the\ndesign and implementation of WEAVE and its data systems, we present the\norganisation, science drivers and design of a five- to seven-year programme of\neight individual surveys to: (i) study our Galaxy's origins by completing\nGaia's phase-space information, providing metallicities to its limiting\nmagnitude for $\sim$3 million stars and detailed abundances for $\sim1.5$\nmillion brighter field and open-cluster stars; (ii) survey $\sim0.4$ million\nGalactic-plane OBA stars, young stellar objects and nearby gas to understand\nthe evolution of young stars and their environments; (iii) perform an extensive\nspectral survey of white dwarfs; (iv) survey $\sim400$\nneutral-hydrogen-selected galaxies with the IFUs; (v) study properties and\nkinematics of stellar populations and ionised gas in $z<0.5$ cluster galaxies;\n(vi) survey stellar populations and kinematics in $\sim25\,000$ field galaxies\nat $0.3\lesssim z \lesssim 0.7$; (vii) study the cosmic evolution of accretion\nand star formation using $>1$ million spectra of LOFAR-selected radio sources;\n(viii) trace structures using intergalactic/circumgalactic gas at $z>2$.\nFinally, we describe the WEAVE Operational Rehearsals using the WEAVE\nSimulator.</td>

      <td>Can ultralight dark matter explain the age-velocity dispersion relation of the Milky Way disc: A revised and improved treatment</td>
      <td>Ultralight axion-like particles $m_a \sim 10^{-22}$ eV, or Fuzzy Dark Matter\n(FDM), behave comparably to cold dark matter (CDM) on cosmological scales and\nexhibit a kpc-size de Broglie wavelength capable of alleviating established\n(sub-)galactic-scale problems of CDM. Substructures inside an FDM halo incur\ngravitational potential perturbations, resulting in stellar heating sufficient\nto account for the Galactic disc thickening over a Hubble time, as first\ndemonstrated by Church et al. We present a more sophisticated treatment that\nincorporates the full baryon and dark matter distributions of the Milky Way and\nadopts stellar disc kinematics inferred from recent Gaia, APOGEE, and LAMOST\nsurveys. Ubiquitous density granulation and subhalo passages respectively drive\ninner disc thickening and flaring of the outer disc, resulting in an\nobservationally consistent `U-shaped' disc vertical velocity dispersion profile\nwith the global minimum located near the solar radius. The observed\nage-velocity dispersion relation in the solar vicinity can be explained by the\nFDM-substructure-induced heating and places an exclusion bound $m_a \gtrsim\n0.4\times10^{-22}$ eV. We assess non-trivial uncertainties in the empirical\ncore-halo relation, FDM subhalo mass function and tidal stripping, and stellar\nheating estimate. The mass range $m_a\simeq 0.5-0.7\times10^{-22}$ eV favoured\nby the observed thick disc kinematics is in tension with several exclusion\nbounds inferred from dwarf density profiles, stellar streams, and Milky Way\nsatellite populations, which could be significantly relaxed due to the\naforesaid uncertainties. Additionally, strongly anisotropic heating could help\nexplain the formation of ultra-thin disc galaxies.</td>

      <td>We present predictions, derived from the EAGLE LCDM cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations, for the abundance and properties of galaxies\nexpected to be detected at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST). We consider the galaxy population as a whole and focus on the\nsub-population of progenitors of Milky Way (MW) analogues, defined to be\ngalaxies with accretion histories similar to the MW's, that is, galaxies that\nunderwent a merger resembling the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) event and that\ncontain an analogue of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) satellite today. We\nderive the luminosity function of all EAGLE galaxies in JWST NIRCam passbands,\nin the redshift range z=2-8, taking into account dust obscuration and different\nexposure times. For an exposure time of $T=10^5$s, average MW progenitors are\nobservable as far back as z~6 in most bands, and this changes to z~5 and z~4\nfor the GES and LMC progenitors, respectively. The progenitors of GES and LMC\nanalogues are, on average, ~2 and ~1 mag fainter than the MW progenitors at\nmost redshifts. They lie, on average, within ~60 and ~30 arcsec, respectively,\nof their future MW host at all times, and thus will appear within the\nfield-of-view of JWST NIRCam. We conclude that galaxies resembling the main\nprogenitor of the MW and its major accreted components should be observable\nwith JWST beyond redshift 2, providing a new and unique window in studying the\nformation history of our own galaxy.</td>

      <td>New constraints on the dark matter density profiles of dwarf galaxies from proper motions of globular cluster streams</td>
      <td>The central density profiles in dwarf galaxy halos depend strongly on the\nnature of dark matter. Recently, in Malhan et al. (2021), we employed N-body\nsimulations to show that the cuspy cold dark matter (CDM) subhalos predicted by\ncosmological simulations can be differentiated from cored subhalos using the\nproperties of accreted globular cluster (GC) streams since these GCs experience\ntidal stripping within their parent halos prior to accretion onto the Milky\nWay. We previously found that clusters that are accreted within cuspy subhalos\nproduce streams with larger physical widths and higher dispersions in\nline-of-sight velocity and angular momentum than streams that are accreted\nwithin cored subhalos. Here, we use the same suite of simulations to\ndemonstrate that the dispersion in the tangential velocities of streams\n($\sigma_{v_\mathrm{Tan}}$) is also sensitive to the central DM density\nprofiles of their parent dwarfs and GCs that were accreted from: cuspy subhalos\nproduce streams with larger $\sigma_{v_\mathrm{Tan}}$ than those accreted\ninside cored subhalos. Using Gaia EDR3 observations of multiple GC streams we\ncompare their $\sigma_{v_\mathrm{Tan}}$ values with simulations. The measured\n$\sigma_{v_\mathrm{Tan}}$ values are consistent with both an ``in situ'' origin\nand with accretion inside cored subhalos of $M\sim 10^{8-9}M_{\odot}$ (or very\nlow-mass cuspy subhalos of mass $\sim 10^8M_{\odot}$). Despite the large\ncurrent uncertainties in $\sigma_{v_\mathrm{Tan}}$, we find a low probability\nthat any of the progenitor GCs were accreted from cuspy subhalos of $M_{\rm\nsubhalo}\buildrel > \over \sim$ $10^9 M_{\odot}$. The uncertainties on Gaia\ntangential velocity measurements are expected to decrease in future and will\nallow for stronger constraints on subhalo DM density profiles.</td>

      <td>Cannibals in the thick disk II -- Radial-velocity monitoring of the young alpha-rich stars</td>
      <td>Determining ages of stars for reconstructing the history of the Milky Way\nremains one of the most difficult tasks in astrophysics. This involves knowing\nwhen it is possible to relate the stellar mass with its age and when it is not.\nThe young $\alpha-$rich (YAR) stars present such a case in which we are still\nnot sure about their ages because they are relatively massive, implying young\nages, but their abundances are $\alpha-$enhanced, which implies old ages. We\nreport the results from new observations from a long-term\nradial-velocity-monitoring campaign complemented with high-resolution\nspectroscopy, as well as new astrometry and seismology of a sample of 41 red\ngiants from the third version of APOKASC, which includes YAR stars. The aim is\nto better characterize the YAR stars in terms of binarity, mass, abundance\ntrends, and kinematic properties.The radial velocities of HERMES, APOGEE, and\nGaia were combined to determine the binary fraction among YAR stars. In\ncombination with their mass estimate, evolutionary status, chemical\ncomposition, and kinematic properties, it allowed us to better constrain the\nnature of these objects. We found that stars with $\mathrm{M} < 1\n\mathrm{M}_\odot$ were all single, whereas stars with $\mathrm{M} > 1\n\mathrm{M}_\odot$ could be either single or binary. This is in agreement with\ntheoretical predictions of population synthesis models. Studying their [C/N],\n[C/Fe], and [N/Fe], trends with mass, it became clear that many YAR stars do\nnot follow the APOKASC stars, favoring the scenario that most of them are the\nproduct of mass transfer.

We undertake a comparison between the most recent data\nreleases of these surveys to investigate the accuracy and precision of derived\nparameters by placing the abundances on an absolute scale. We discuss the\ncorrelations in parameter and abundance differences as a function of main\nparameters. Uncovering the variants provides a basis to on-going efforts of\nfuture sky surveys. Quality samples from the APOGEE-GALAH, APOGEE-GES and\nGALAH-GES overlapping catalogs are collected. We investigate the mean variants\nbetween the surveys, and linear trends are also investigated. We compare the\nslope of correlations and mean differences with the reported uncertainties. The\naverage and scatter of vrad, Teff, log g, [M/H] and vmicro, along with numerous\nspecies of elemental abundances in the combined catalogs show that in general\nthere is a good agreement between the surveys. We find large radial velocity\nscatters ranging from 1.3 km/s to 4.4 km/s when comparing the three surveys. We\nobserve weak trends: e.g. in $\Delta$Teff vs. $\Delta$log g for the APOGEE-GES\nstars, and a clear correlation in the vmicro-$\Delta$vmicro planes in the\nAPOGEE-GALAH common sample. For [$\alpha$/H], [Ti/H] (APOGEE-GALAH giants) and\n[Al/H] (APOGEE-GALAH dwarfs) potential strong correlations are discovered as a\nfunction of the differences in the main atmospheric parameters, and we find\nweak trends for other elements. In general we find good agreement between the\nthree surveys within their respective uncertainties. However, there are certain\nregimes in which strong variants exist, which we discuss. There are still\noffsets larger than 0.1 dex in the absolute abundance scales.</td>

In this work,\nwe explore the dynamics of disk tilting by running N-body simulations of\nmergers in an isolated, isotropic Milky Way-like host galaxy, varying over\nsatellite virial mass, initial position, and orbit. We develop and validate a\nfirst-principles understanding of the dynamics that govern how the host\ngalaxy's stellar disk responds to the satellite's dark matter debris. We find\nthat the degree of disk tilting can be large for cosmologically-motivated\nmerger histories. In particular, our results suggest that the Galactic disk may\nstill be tilting in response to Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, one of the most\nsignificant recent mergers in the Milky Way's history. These findings have\nimplications for terrestrial direct detection experiments as disk tilting\nchanges the relative location of the Sun with respect to dark matter\nsubstructure left behind by a merging galaxy.</td>

We use models and isochrones from the Dartmouth\nStellar Evolution Database (DSED) and Bag of Stellar Tracks and Isochrones\n(BaSTI) for $\alpha$-enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe]$=+0.4$ and different helium\nabundances. The metallicities [Fe/H]$=-1.04\pm0.07$ and $-1.09\pm0.06$ are\nderived from the red giant branch slopes in our fitting for NGC\,6362 and\nNGC\,6723, respectively. They agree with spectroscopic estimates from the\nliterature. We find a differential reddening up to $\Delta E(B-V)=0.13$ mag in\nthe NGC\,6723 field due to the adjacent Corona Australis cloud complex. We\nderive the following for NGC\,6362 and NGC\,6723, respectively: distances\n$7.75\pm0.03\pm0.15$ (statistic and systematic error) and $8.15\pm0.04\pm0.15$\nkpc; ages $12.0\pm0.1\pm0.8$ and $12.4\pm0.1\pm0.8$ Gyr; extinctions\n$A_\mathrm{V}=0.19\pm0.04\pm0.06$ and $0.24\pm0.03\pm0.06$ mag; reddenings\n$E(B-V)=0.056\pm0.01\pm0.02$ and $0.068\pm0.01\pm0.02$ mag. DSED provides\nsystematically lower [Fe/H] and higher reddenings than BaSTI. However, the\nmodels agree in their relative estimates: NGC\,6723 is $0.44\pm0.04$ kpc\nfurther, $0.5\pm0.1$ Gyr older, $\Delta E(B-V)=0.007\pm0.002$ more reddened,\nand with $0.05\pm0.01$ dex lower [Fe/H] than NGC\,6362. The lower metallicity\nand greater age of NGC\,6723 with respect to NGC\,6362 explain their horizontal\nbranch morphology difference. This confirms age as the second parameter for\nthese clusters.

Invoking the complete form\nof Jeans equations that admit three integrals of motion, we use the independent\n$R$- and $z$-directional equations as two discriminators ($T_R$ and $T_z$). We\napply the formula for spatial distributions of radial and vertical velocity\ndispersions proposed by Binney et al., and successfully extend it to azimuthal\ncomponents, $\sigma_\theta(R,z)$ and $V_\theta(R,z)$; the analytic form avoids\nthe numerical artifacts caused by numerical differentiation in Jeans-equations\ncalculation given the limited spatial resolutions of observations, and more\nimportantly reduces the impact of kinematic substructures in the Galactic disk.\nIt turns out that whereas the current kinematic data are able to reject\nMoffat's Modified Gravity (let alone the Newtonian baryon-only model),\nMilgrom's MOND is still not rejected. In fact, both the carefully calibrated\nfiducial model invoking a spherical dark matter (DM) halo and MOND are equally\nconsistent with the data at almost all spatial locations (except that probably\nboth have respective problems at low-$|z|$ locations), no matter which a tracer\npopulation or which a meaningful density profile is used. Because there is no\nfree parameter at all in the quasi-linear MOND model we use, and the baryonic\nparameters are actually fine-tuned in the DM context, such an effective\nequivalence is surprising, and might be calling forth a transcending synthesis\nof the two paradigms.</td>

      <td>Characterization and dynamics of the peculiar stream Jhelum, A tentative role for the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy</td>
      <td>Stellar streams are a promising tool to study the Milky Way's dark matter\nsubhalo population, as interactions with subhalos could produce substructure in\nstreams. However, other possible causes for substructure first need to be well\nunderstood. Here we studied the kinematics and the unusual morphology of the\nstellar stream Jhelum. Using a combination of ground-based photometry and Gaia\nEDR3 astrometry, we characterized the morphology of Jhelum. We combined this\nnew data with radial velocities from the literature to perform orbit\nintegrations of the stream in static Galactic potentials. We also carried out\nN-body simulations in the presence of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The new\ndata reveal a previously unreported tertiary component in the stream, as well\nas several gaps and a kink-like feature in its narrow component. We find that\nfor a range of realistic Galactic potentials, no single orbit is able to\nreproduce Jhelum's radial velocity data entirely. A generic property of the\norbital solutions is that they share a similar orbital plane to Sagittarius and\nthis leads to repeated encounters with the stream. Using N-body simulations\nthat include a massive Sagittarius, we explored its effect on Jhelum, and we\nshow that these encounters can qualitatively reproduce the narrow and broad\ncomponents in Jhelum, as well as create a tertiary component in some cases. We\nalso find evidence that such encounters can result in an apparent increase in\nthe velocity dispersion of the stream by a factor up to four due to overlapping\nnarrow and broad components. Our findings suggest that the Jhelum stream is\neven more complex than once thought; however, its morphology and kinematics can\ntentatively be explained via the interactions with Sagittarius. In this\nscenario, the formation of Jhelum's narrow and broad components occurs\nnaturally, yet some of the smaller gap-like features remain to be explained.</td>

      <td>Searching for the extra-tidal stars of globular clusters using high-dimensional analysis and a core particle spray code</td>
      <td>Three-body interactions can eject stars from the core of a globular cluster,\ncausing them to enter the Galactic halo as extra-tidal stars. While finding\nextra-tidal stars is imperative for understanding cluster evolution, connecting\nisolated extra-tidal field stars back to their birth cluster is extremely\ndifficult. In this work, we present a new methodology consisting of\nhigh-dimensional data analysis and a particle spray code to identify\nextra-tidal stars of any Galactic globular cluster using M3 as a case study.\nUsing the t-Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) and Uniform Manifold\nApproximation and Projection (UMAP) machine learning dimensionality reduction\nalgorithms, we first identify a set of 103 extra-tidal candidates in the APOGEE\nDR17 data catalogue with chemical abundances similar to M3 stars. To confirm\neach candidate's extra-tidal nature, we introduce corespray - a new\nPython-based three-body particle spray code that simulates extra-tidal stars\nfor any Galactic globular cluster. Using Gaia EDR3 proper motions and APOGEE\nDR17 radial velocities, we apply multivariate Gaussian modelling and an extreme\ndeconvolution to identify the extra-tidal candidates that are more likely to be\nassociated with a distribution of corespray-simulated M3 extra-tidal stars than\nthe field. Through these methods, we identify 10 new high-probability\nextra-tidal stars produced via three-body interactions in M3. We also explore\nwhether any of our extra-tidal candidates are consistent with being ejected\nfrom M3 through different dynamical processes. Future applications of corespray\nwill yield better understandings of core dynamics, star formation histories and\nbinary fractions in globular clusters.</td>

      <td>The Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) V: a chemo-dynamical investigation of the early assembly of the Milky Way with the most metal-poor stars in the bulge</td>
      <td>The investigation of the metal-poor tail in the Galactic bulge provides\nunique information on the early Milky Way assembly and evolution. A\nchemo-dynamical analysis of 17 very metal-poor stars (VMP, [Fe/H] $<-2.0$)\nselected from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey was carried out based on\nGemini/GRACES spectra. The chemistry suggests that the majority of our stars\nare very similar to metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo. Orbits calculated\nfrom {\it Gaia} EDR3 imply these stars are brought into the bulge during the\nearliest Galactic assembly. Most of our stars have large [Na,Ca/Mg] abundances,\nand thus show little evidence of enrichment by pair-instability supernovae. Two\nof our stars (P171457, P184700) have chemical abundances compatible with\nsecond-generation globular cluster stars, suggestive of the presence of ancient\nand now dissolved globular clusters in the inner Galaxy. One of them (P171457)\nis extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] $<-3.0$) and well below the metallicity floor\nof globular clusters, which supports the growing evidence for the existence of\nlower-metallicity globular clusters in the early Universe. A third star\n(P180956, [Fe/H] $\sim-2$) has low [Na,Ca/Mg] and very low [Ba/Fe] for its\nmetallicity, which are consistent with formation in a system polluted by only\none or a few low-mass supernovae. Interestingly, its orbit is confined to the\nGalactic plane, like other very metal-poor stars found in the literature, which\nhave been associated with the earliest building blocks of the Milky Way.</td>

      <td>MINCE I. Presentation of the project and of the first year sample</td>
      <td>In recent years, Galactic archaeology has become a particularly vibrant field\nof astronomy, with its main focus set on the oldest stars of our Galaxy. In\nmost cases, these stars have been identified as the most metal-poor. However,\nthe struggle to find these ancient fossils has produced an important bias in\nthe observations - in particular, the intermediate metal-poor stars\n(-2.5<[Fe/H]< -1.5) have been frequently overlooked. The missing information\nhas consequences for the precise study of the chemical enrichment of our\nGalaxy, in particular for what concerns neutron-capture elements and it will be\nonly partially covered by future multi-object spectroscopic surveys such as\nWEAVE and 4MOST. Measuring at Intermediate Metallicity Neutron Capture Elements\n(MINCE) is gathering the first high-quality spectra (high S/N ratio and high\nresolution) for several hundreds of bright and metal-poor stars, mainly located\nin our Galactic halo. We compiled our selection mainly on the basis of Gaia\ndata and determined the stellar atmospheres of our sample and the chemical\nabundances of each star. In this paper, we present the first sample of 59\nspectra of 46 stars. We measured the radial velocities and computed the\nGalactic orbits for all stars. We found that 8 stars belong to the thin disc,\n15 to disrupted satellites, and the remaining cannot be associated to the\nmentioned structures, and we call them halo stars. For 33 of these stars, we\nprovide abundances for the elements up to zinc. We also show the chemical\nevolution results for eleven chemical elements, based on recent models. Our\nobservational strategy of using multiple telescopes and spectrographs to\nacquire high S/N and high-resolution spectra has proven to be very efficient\nsince the present sample was acquired over only about one year of observations.\nFinally, our target selection strategy proved satisfactory for our purposes.</td>

      <td>We identify and characterise a Milky Way-like realisation from the Auriga\nsimulations with two consecutive massive mergers $\sim2\,$Gyr apart at high\nredshift, comparable to the reported Kraken and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus. The\nKraken-like merger ($z=1.6$, $M_{\rm Tot} = 8\times10^{10}\,$M$_{\odot}$) is\ngas-rich, deposits most of its mass in the inner $10\,$kpc, and is largely\nisotropic. The Sausage-like merger ($z=1.14$, $M_{\rm Tot} =\n1\times10^{11}\,$M$_{\odot}$) leaves a more extended mass distribution at\nhigher energies, and has a radially anisotropic distribution. For the higher\nredshift merger, the stellar mass ratio of the satellite to host galaxy is 1:3.\nAs a result, the chemistry of the remnant is indistinguishable from\ncontemporaneous in-situ populations, making it challenging to identify this\ncomponent through chemical abundances. This naturally explains why all\nabundance patterns attributed so far to Kraken are in fact fully consistent\nwith the metal-poor in-situ so-called Aurora population and thick disc.\nHowever, our model makes a falsifiable prediction: if the Milky Way underwent a\ngas-rich double merger at high redshift, then this should be imprinted on its\nstar formation history with bursts about $\sim2\,$Gyrs apart. This may offer\nconstraining power on the highest-redshift major mergers.</td>

For the number counts, we carefully masked spatial regions that are\ncompromised by open clusters, great distances, or dust extinction and used\nGaussian processes to arrive at a smooth, non-parametric estimate for the\nunderlying number density field. We find that the number density and velocity\nfields depart significantly from an axisymmetric and mirror-symmetric model.\nThese departures, which include projections of the Gaia phase-space spiral,\nsignal the presence of local disturbances in the disk. We identify two features\nthat are present in both stellar number density and mean vertical velocity. One\nof these features appears to be associated with the Local Spiral Arm. It is\nmost prominent at small heights and is largely symmetric across the mid-plane\nof the disk. The density and velocity field perturbations are phase-shifted by\nroughly a quarter wavelength, suggesting a breathing mode that is propagating\nin the direction of Galactic longitude $l\sim 270$ deg. The second feature is a\ngradient in the stellar number density and mean vertical velocity with respect\nto Galactocentric radius. This feature, which extends across the entire region\nof our analysis, may be associated with the extension of the Galactic warp into\nthe Solar neighbourhood in combination with more localised bending waves.</td>

      <td>The spatial distribution of elemental abundances and their time evolution are\namong the major constraints to disentangle the scenarios of formation and\nevolution of the Galaxy. We used the sample of open clusters available in the\nfinal release of the Gaia-ESO survey to trace the Galactic radial abundance and\nabundance to iron ratio gradients, and their time evolution. We selected member\nstars in 62 open clusters, with ages from 0.1 to about 7~Gyr, located in the\nGalactic thin disc at Galactocentric radii from about 6 to 21~kpc. We analysed\nthe shape of the resulting [Fe/H] gradient, the average gradients [El/H] and\n[El/Fe] combining elements belonging to four different nucleosynthesis\nchannels, and their individual abundance and abundance ratio gradients. We also\ninvestigated the time evolution of the gradients dividing open clusters in\nthree age bins. The[Fe/H] gradient has a slope of -0.054 dex~kpc-1. We saw\ndifferent behaviours for elements belonging to different channels. We found\nthat the youngest clusters in the inner disc have lower metallicity than their\nolder counterpart and they outline a flatter gradient. We considered some\npossible explanations, including the effects of gas inflow and migration. We\nsuggested that it might be a bias introduced by the standard spectroscopic\nanalysis producing lower metallicities in low gravity stars. To delineate the\nshape of the `true' gradient, we should limit our analysis to stars with low\nsurface gravity logg>2.5 and xi<1.8 km~s-1. Based on this reduced sample, we\ncan conclude that the gradient has minimally evolved over the time-frame\noutlined by the open clusters, indicating a slow and stationary formation of\nthe thin disc in the latest Gyr. We found a secondary role of clusters'\nmigration in shaping the gradient, with a more prominent role of migration for\nthe oldest clusters.</td>

The\nasymmetry between the number of stars in the leading and trailing tails tests\ngravitational theory. All five open clusters with tail data (Hyades, Praesepe,\nComa Berenices, COIN-Gaia 13, NGC 752) have visibly more stars within dcl = 50\npc of their centre in their leading than their trailing tail. Using the\nJerabkova-compact-convergent-point (CCP) method, the extended tails have been\nmapped out for four nearby 600-2000 Myr old open clusters to dcl>50 pc. These\nare on near-circular Galactocentric orbits, a formula for estimating the\norbital eccentricity of an open cluster being derived. Applying the Phantom of\nRamses code to this problem, in Newtonian gravitation the tails are\nnear-symmetrical. In Milgromian dynamics (MOND) the asymmetry reaches the\nobserved values for 50 < dcl/pc < 200, being maximal near peri-galacticon, and\ncan slightly invert near apo-galacticon, and the K\"upper epicyclic\noverdensities are asymmetrically spaced. Clusters on circular orbits develop\norbital eccentricity due to the asymmetrical spill-out, therewith spinning up\nopposite to their orbital angular momentum. This positive dynamical feedback\nsuggests Milgromian open clusters to demise rapidly as their orbital\neccentricity keeps increasing. Future work is necessary to better delineate the\ntidal tails around open clusters of different ages and to develop a Milgromian\ndirect n-body code.</td>

      <td>Aims. Stars with strong enhancements of r-process elements are rare and tend\nto be metal-poor, with generally [Fe/H] <-2 dex and found in the halo. In this\nwork we aim to investigate a candidate r-process enriched bulge star with a\nrelatively high metallicity of -0.65 dex, and compare it with a previously\npublished r-rich candidate star in the bulge. Methods. We reconsider the\nabundance analysis of a high-resolution optical spectrum of the red-giant star\n2MASS J18082459-2548444 and determine its europium (Eu) and molybdenum (Mo)\nabundance, using stellar parameters from five different previous studies.\nApplying 2MASS photometry, Gaia astrometry and kinematics, we estimate\ndistance, orbits, and population membership of 2MASS J18082459-2548444 and a\npreviously reported r-enriched star 2MASS J18174532-3353235. Results. We find\nthat 2MASS J18082459-2548444 is a relatively metal rich enriched r-process star\nthat is enhanced in Eu and Mo but not substantially enhanced in s-process\nelements. It has a high probability of membership in the Galactic bulge based\non its distance and orbit. We find that both stars show r-process enhancement\nwith elevated [Eu/Fe]-values, even though 2MASS J18174532-3353235 is 1 dex\nlower in metallicity. Additionally, we find that 2MASS J18174532-3353235\nplausibly has a halo or thick disc origin. Conclusions.

      <td>The three-dimensional structure of Galactic molecular cloud complexes out to 2.5 kpc</td>
      <td>Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of Galactic molecular clouds is\nimportant for understanding how clouds are affected by processes such as\nturbulence and magnetic fields and how this structure effects star formation\nwithin them. Great progress has been made in this field with the arrival of the\nGaia mission, which provides accurate distances to $\sim10^{9}$ stars.\nCombining these distances with extinctions inferred from optical-IR, we recover\nthe three-dimensional structure of 16 Galactic molecular cloud complexes at\n$\sim1$pc resolution using our novel three-dimensional dust mapping algorithm\n\texttt{Dustribution}. Using \texttt{astrodendro} we derive a catalogue of\nphysical parameters for each complex. We recover structures with aspect ratios\nbetween 1 and 11, i.e.\ everything from near-spherical to very elongated\nshapes. We find a large variation in cloud environments that is not apparent\nwhen studying them in two-dimensions. For example, the nearby California and\nOrion A clouds look similar on-sky, but we find California to be more\nsheet-like, and massive, which could explain their different star-formation\nrates. In Carina, our most distant complex, we observe evidence for dust\nsputtering, which explains its measured low dust mass. By calculating the total\nmass of these individual clouds, we demonstrate that it is necessary to define\ncloud boundaries in three-dimensions in order to obtain an accurate mass;\nsimply integrating the extinction overestimates masses. We find that Larson's\nrelationship on mass vs radius holds true whether you assume a spherical shape\nfor the cloud or take their true extents.</td>

      <td>The Kinematic Properties of Milky Way Stellar Halo Populations</td>
      <td>In the $Gaia$ era stellar kinematics are extensively used to study Galactic\nhalo stellar populations, to search for halo structures, and to characterize\nthe interface between the halo and hot disc populations. We use distribution\nfunction-based models of modern datasets with 6D phase space data to\nqualitatively describe a variety of kinematic spaces commonly used in the study\nof the Galactic halo. Furthermore, we quantitatively assess how well each\nkinematic space can separate radially anisotropic from isotropic halo\npopulations. We find that scaled action space (the ``action diamond'') is\nsuperior to other commonly used kinematic spaces at this task. We present a\nnew, easy to implement selection criterion for members of the\nradially-anisotropic $Gaia$-Enceladus merger remnant. Assuming a 1:1 ratio of\n$Gaia$-Enceladus stars to more isotropic halo, we find our selection achieves a\nsample purity of 82 per cent in our models with respect to contamination from\nthe more isotropic halo. We compare this criterion to literature criteria,\nfinding that it produces the highest purity in the resulting samples, at the\nexpense of a modest reduction in completeness. We also show that selection\nbiases that underlie nearly all contemporary spectroscopic datasets can\nnoticeably impact the $E-L_{z}$ distribution of samples in a manner that may be\nconfused for real substructure. We conclude by providing recommendations for\nhow authors should use stellar kinematics in the future to study the Galactic\nstellar halo.</td>

We aim at deriving mean metallicities and radial velocities\nfor 13 GCs that lie towards the bulge and are generally associated with this\ncomponent. We use near infrared low resolution spectroscopy with the FORS2\ninstrument on the VLT to measure the wavelengths and equivalent widths of the\nCaII triplet (CaT) lines for a number of stars per cluster. We derive radial\nvelocities, ascertain membership and apply known calibrations to determine\nmetallicities for cluster members, for a mean of 11 members per cluster. We\nderive mean cluster RV values to 3 km/s, and mean metallicities to 0.05 dex.\nOur sample has metallicities lying between -0.21 and -1.64 and is distributed\nbetween the traditional metal-rich BGC peak near [Fe/H] aprox. -0.5 and a more\nmetal-poor peak around [Fe/H] aprox. -1.1, which has recently been identified.\nThese latter are candidates for the oldest GCs in the Galaxy, if blue\nhorizontal branches are present, and include BH 261, NGC 6401, NGC 6540, NGC\n6642, and Terzan 9. Finally, Terzan 10 is even more metal-poor. However,\ndynamically, Terzan 10 is likely an intruder from the halo, possibly associated\nwith the Gaia-Enceladus or Kraken accretion events. Terzan 10 is also confirmed\nas an Oosterhotype II GC based on our results. The lone halo intruder in our\nsample, Terzan 10, is conspicuous for also having by far the lowest\nmetallicity, and casts doubt on the possibility of any bonafide BGCs at\nmetallicities below about aprox. -1.5.</td>

From the\nNIR images, combined with astrometric data from Gaia EDR3, we estimate the\ndistance to S209 to be 2.5 kpc. This is close enough to enable us to resolve\ncluster members clearly ($\simeq$1000 AU separation) down to a mass-detection\nlimit of $\simeq$0.1 $M_\odot$, and we have identified two star-forming\nclusters in S209, with individual cluster scales $\sim$1 pc.

The IMFs we obtained for both clusters\nexhibit slightly flat high-mass slopes ($\Gamma \simeq -1.0$) compared to the\nSalpeter IMF ($\Gamma = -1.35$), and their break mass of $\simeq$0.1 $M_\odot$\nis lower than those generally seen in the solar neighborhood ($\sim$0.3\n$M_\odot$). In particular, because the S209 main cluster is a star-forming\ncluster with a larger number of members ($\sim$1500) than the number\n($\sim$100) in regions previously studied in such environments, it is possible\nfor the first time to derive the IMF in a low-metallicity environment with high\naccuracy over the wide mass range 0.1--20 $M_\odot$.</td>

      <td>While Gaia has observed the phase space coordinates of over a billion stars\nin the Galaxy, in the overwhelming majority of cases it has only obtained five\nof the six coordinates, the missing dimension being the radial (line-of-sight)\nvelocity. Using a realistic mock dataset, we show that Bayesian neural networks\nare highly capable of 'learning' these radial velocities as a function of the\nother five coordinates, and thus filling in the gaps. For a given star, the\nnetwork outputs are not merely point predictions, but full posterior\ndistributions encompassing the intrinsic scatter of the stellar phase space\ndistribution, the observational uncertainties on the network inputs, and any\n'epistemic' uncertainty stemming from our ignorance about the stellar phase\nspace distribution. Applying this technique to the real Gaia data, we generate\nand publish a catalogue of posteriors (median width: 25 km/s) for the radial\nvelocities of 16 million Gaia DR2/EDR3 stars in the magnitude range 6<G<14.5.\nMany of these gaps will be filled in very soon by Gaia DR3, which will serve to\ntest our blind predictions. Thus, the primary use of our published catalogue\nwill be to validate our method, justifying its future use in generating an\nupdated catalogue of posteriors for radial velocities missing from Gaia DR3.</td>

We\nidentified seven different groups in this region. Four groups (nu Sco, beta\nSco, sigma Sco and delta Sco) are part of Upper Scorpius, two groups (rho Oph\nand alpha Sco) are in Ophiuchus, and another group (pi Sco) is a nearby young\npopulation. We found an age gradient from the rho Oph group (the youngest) to\nthe delta Sco group (<~5 Myr), showing that star formation was a sequential\nprocess for the past 5 Myr. Our traceback analysis shows that Upper Scorpius\nand rho Oph groups share a common origin. The closer group of pi Sco is\nprobably older, and the traceback analysis suggests that this group and the\nalpha Sco group have a different origin, likely related to other associations\nin the Sco-Cen complex. Our study shows that this region has a complex star\nformation history that goes beyond the current formation scenario, likely a\nresult of stellar feedback from massive stars, supernovae explosions, and\ndynamic interactions between stellar groups and the molecular gas. In\nparticular, we speculate that photo-ionisation from the massive delta Sco star\ncould have triggered star formation first in the beta Sco group and then in the\nnu Sco group. The perturbations of stellar orbits due to stellar feedback and\ndynamical interactions could also be responsible for the 1-3 Myr difference\nthat we found between dynamical traceback ages and isochronal ages.</td>

We further show how this behaviour\ntranslates into a bimodality in the velocity distribution of stars in the outer\nMilky Way disc. We use an N-body model of an impulse-like interaction of the\nMilky Way disc with a perturber similar to the Sagittarius dwarf to demonstrate\nthat this mechanism can generate a similar disturbance. It has already been\nshown that this interaction can produce a phase spiral similar to that seen in\nthe Solar neighbourhood. We argue that the details of this substructure in the\nouter galaxy will be highly sensitive to the timing of the perturbation or the\ngravitational potential of the Galaxy, and therefore may be key to\ndisentangling the history and structure of the Milky Way.</td>

      <td>Based on a large spectroscopic sample of $\sim$ 4,300 RR Lyrae stars with\nmetallicity, systemic radial velocity and distance measurements, we present a\ndetailed analysis of the chemical and kinematic properties of the Galactic\nhalo. Using this sample, the metallicity distribution function (MDF) as a\nfunction of $r$ and the velocity anisotropy parameter $\beta$ profiles (for\ndifferent metallicity populations) are derived for the stellar halo. Both the\nchemical and kinematic results suggest that the Galactic halo is composed of\ntwo distinct parts, the inner halo and outer halo. The cutoff radius ($\sim$ 30\nkpc) is similar to the previous break radius found in the density distribution\nof the stellar halo. We find that the inner part is dominated by a metal-rich\npopulation with extremely radial anisotropy ($\beta \sim 0.9$). These features\nare in accordance with those of ``{\it Gaia}-Enceladus-Sausage'' (GES) and we\nattribute this inner halo component as being dominantly composed of stars\ndeposited from this ancient merged satellite. We find that GES probably has a\nslightly negative metallicity gradient. The metal-poor populations in the inner\nhalo are characterized as a long-tail in MDF with an anisotropy of $\beta \sim\n0.5$, which is similar to that of the outer part. The MDF for the outer halo is\nvery broad with several weak peaks and the value of $\beta$ is around 0.5 for\nall metallicities.</td>

Using the Besancon Galaxy Model we derive a\npotential and the disc stellar distribution functions are computed based on\nthree integrals of motion to model stationary stellar discs. The gravitational\npotential and the stellar distribution functions are built self-consistently,\nand then adjusted to be in agreement with the kinematics and the density\ndistributions obtained from Gaia observations. A Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) is used to fit the free parameters of the dynamical model to Gaia\nparallax and proper motion distributions.\n  The fit is done on several sets of Gaia eDR3 data, widely spread in\nlongitudes and latitudes. We are able to determine the velocity dispersion\nellipsoid and its tilt for sub-components of different ages, both varying with\nR and z. The density laws and their radial scale lengths, for the thin and\nthick disc populations are also obtained self-consistently. This new model has\nsome interesting characteristics, such as a flaring thin disc. The thick disc\nis found to present very distinctive characteristics from the old thin disc,\nboth in density and kinematics. This well supports the idea that thin and thick\ndiscs were formed in distinct scenarios as the density and kinematics\ntransition between them is found to be abrupt. The dark matter halo is shown to\nbe nearly spherical. We also derive the Solar motion to be (10.79 $\pm$ 0.56,\n11.06 $\pm$ 0.94, 7.66 $\pm$ 0.43) km/s, in good agreement with recent studies.\nThe resulting fully self-consistent gravitational potential, still\naxisymmetric, is a good approximation of a smooth mass distribution in the\nMilky Way and can be used for further studies, including to compute orbits for\nreal stars in our Galaxy (abridged).</td>

We present\nnear-infrared (NIR, $JHK_s$) time-series observations of 42 RRL, 8 T2Cs, and 10\neclipsing binary candidate variables in NGC 6441. The multi-epoch observations\nwere obtained using the FLAMINGOS-2 instrument on the 8-m Gemini South\ntelescope. Multi-band data are used to investigate pulsation properties of RRL\nand T2C variables including their light curves, instability strip,\nperiod--amplitude diagrams, and period--luminosity and period--wesenheit\nrelations (PLRs and PWRs) in $JHK_s$ filters. NIR pulsation properties of RRL\nvariables are well fitted with theoretical models that have canonical helium\ncontent and mean-metallicity of NGC 6441 ([Fe/H]$=-0.44\pm0.07$~dex). The\nhelium-enhanced RRL models predict brighter NIR magnitudes and bluer colors\nthan the observations of RRL in the cluster. This suggests that these RRL\nvariables in NGC 6441 are either not significantly helium enhanced as\npreviously thought or the impact of such enhancement is smaller in NIR than the\npredictions of the pulsation models. We also use theoretical calibrations of\nRRL period--luminosity--metallicity (PLZ) relations to simultaneously estimate\nthe mean reddening, $E(J-K_s)=0.26\pm0.06$~mag, and the distance,\n$d=12.67\pm0.09$~kpc, to NGC 6441. Our mean reddening value and the distance\nare consistent with the independent estimates from the bulge reddening map\nbased on red clump stars and the latest Gaia data, respectively. Our distance\nand reddening values provide a very good agreement between the PLRs of T2Cs in\nNGC 6441 and those for RRL and T2Cs in Galactic globular clusters that span a\nbroad range of metallicity.</td>

To rectify this, we\npresent a neural network approach for estimating the metallicities and\ndistances of red giant stars with 8-band photometry and parallaxes from Gaia\nEDR3 and the 2MASS and WISE surveys. The algorithm accounts for uncertainties\nin the predictions arising from the range of possible outputs at each input and\nfrom the range of models compatible with the training set (through drop-out). A\ntwo-stage procedure is adopted where an initial network to estimate\nphoto-astrometric parallaxes is trained using a large sample of noisy parallax\ndata from Gaia EDR3 and then a secondary network is trained using spectroscopic\nmetallicities from the APOGEE and LAMOST surveys and an augmented feature space\nutilising the first-stage parallax estimates. The algorithm produces\nmetallicity predictions with an average uncertainty of $\pm0.19$ dex. The\nmethodology is applied to stars within the Galactic bar/bulge with particular\nfocus on a sample of 1.69 million objects with Gaia radial velocities. We\ndemonstrate the use and validity of our approach by inspecting both spatial and\nkinematic gradients with metallicity in the Galactic bar/bulge recovering\nprevious results on the vertical metallicity gradient ($-0.528 \pm 0.002$\ndex/kpc) and the vertex deviation of the bar ($-21.29 \pm 2.74$ deg).</td>

      <td>The Poor Old Heart of the Milky Way</td>
      <td>Massive disk galaxies like our Milky Way should host an ancient, metal-poor,\nand centrally concentrated stellar population. This population reflects the\nstar formation and enrichment in the few most massive progenitor components\nthat coalesced at high redshift to form the proto-Galaxy. While metal-poor\nstars are known to reside in the inner few kiloparsecs of our Galaxy, current\ndata do not yet provide a comprehensive picture of such a metal-poor "heart" of\nthe Milky Way. We use information from Gaia DR3, especially the XP spectra, to\nconstruct a sample of 2 million bright (BP $<15.5$ mag) giant stars within\n$30^\circ$ of the Galactic Center with robust [M/H] estimates, $\delta$ [M/H]\n$\lesssim 0.1$. For most sample members we can calculate orbits based on Gaia\nRVS velocities and astrometry. This sample reveals an extensive, ancient, and\nmetal-poor population that includes $\sim 18,000$ stars with $-2.7<$ [M/H]\n$<-1.5$, representing a stellar mass of $\gtrsim 5\times 10^7$ M$_\odot$. The\nspatial distribution of these [M/H] $<-1.5$ stars has a Gaussian extent of only\n$\sigma_{\mathrm{R_{GC}}} \sim 2.7$ kpc around the Galactic center, with most\nof these orbits being confined to the inner Galaxy. At high orbital\neccentricities, there is clear evidence for accreted halo stars in their\npericentral orbit phase. Stars with [M/H] $< -2$ show no net rotation, whereas\nthose with [M/H] $\sim -1$ are rotation dominated. Most of the tightly bound\nstars show $[\alpha/\text{Fe}]$-enhancement and [Al/Fe]-[Mn/Fe] abundance\npatterns expected for an origin in the more massive portions of the\nproto-Galaxy. These central, metal-poor stars most likely predate the oldest\npart of the disk ($\tau_{\text{age}}\approx 12.5$ Gyrs), which implies that\nthey formed at $z\gtrsim 5$, forging the proto-Milky Way.</td>

      <td>Tracing the Milky Way warp and spiral arms with classical Cepheids</td>
      <td>Mapping the Galactic spiral structure is a difficult task since the Sun is\nlocated in the Galactic plane and because of dust extinction. For these\nreasons, molecular masers in radio wavelengths have been used with great\nsuccess to trace the Milky Way spiral arms. Recently, Gaia parallaxes have\nhelped in investigating the spiral structure in the Solar extended\nneighborhood. In this paper, we propose to determine the location of the spiral\narms using Cepheids since they are bright, young supergiants with accurate\ndistances (they are the first ladder of the extragalactic distance scale). They\ncan be observed at very large distances; therefore, we need to take the\nGalactic warp into account. Thanks to updated mid-infrared photometry and to\nthe most complete catalog of Galactic Cepheids, we derived the parameters of\nthe warp using a robust regression method. Using a clustering algorithm, we\nidentified groups of Cepheids after having corrected their Galactocentric\ndistances from the (small) effects of the warp. We derived new parameters for\nthe Galactic warp, and we show that the warp cannot be responsible for the\nincreased dispersion of abundance gradients in the outer disk reported in\nprevious studies. We show that Cepheids can be used to trace spiral arms, even\nat large distances from the Sun. The groups we identify are consistent with\nprevious studies explicitly deriving the position of spiral arms using young\ntracers (masers, OB(A) stars) or mapping overdensities of upper main-sequence\nstars in the Solar neighborhood thanks to Gaia data.</td>

      <td>Super metal-rich (SMR) stars in the solar neighborhood are thought to be born\nin the inner disk and came to present location by radial migration, which is\nmost intense at the co-rotation resonance (CR) of the Galactic bar. In this\nwork, we show evidence for the CR origin of SMR stars in LAMOST-Gaia by\ndetecting six ridges and undulations in the phi versus Lz space coded by median\nVR, following a similar slope of -8 km/s kpc/deg. The slope is predicted by\nMonario et al.'s model for CR of a large and slow Galactic bar. For the first\ntime, we show the variation of angular momentum with azimuths from -10 deg to\n20 deg for two outer and broad undulations with negative VR around -18 km/s\nfollowing this slope. The wave-like pattern with large amplitude outside CR and\na wide peak of the second undulations indicate that minor merger of the\nSagittarius dwarf galaxy with the disk might play a role besides the\nsignificant impact of CR of the Galactic bar.</td>

The samples are\nselected using effective temperatures and surface gravities from the GSP-Spec\nmodule, and are expected to trace stellar populations of different typical age.\nThe cool (old) giants exhibit a relatively smooth radial metallicity gradient\nwith an azimuthal dependence. Binning in Galactic azimuth $\phi$, the slope\ngradually varies from $d$[M/H]$/dR \sim -0.054$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ at $\phi \sim\n-20^{\circ}$ to $\sim -0.035$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ at $\phi \sim 20^{\circ}$. On the\nother hand, the relatively hotter (and younger) stars present remarkable\ninhomogeneities, apparent as three (possibly four) metal-rich elongated\nfeatures in correspondence of the spiral arms' locations in the Galactic disc.\nWhen projected onto Galactic radius, those features manifest themselves as\nstatistically significant bumps on top of the observed radial metallicity\ngradients with amplitudes up to $ \sim 0.05-0.1$ dex, making the assumption of\na linear radial decrease not applicable to this sample. The strong correlation\nbetween the spiral structure of the Galaxy and the observed chemical pattern in\nthe young sample indicates that the spiral arms might be at the origin for the\ndetected chemical inhomogeneities. In this scenario, the spiral arms would\nleave in the younger stars a strong signature, which progressively disappears\nwhen cooler (and older) giants are considered.</td>

      <td>We investigate the effects of a massive ($\gtrsim4\times10^{10}M_\odot$)\nSagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr) on stellar streams using test\nparticle simulations in a realistic Milky Way potential. We find that Sgr can\neasily disrupt streams formed more than $\sim3$ Gyr ago, while stars stripped\nmore recently are generally unaffected. In certain realizations, Sgr is able to\nproduce asymmetry between the leading and trailing tails of Pal 5,\nqualitatively similar to observations. Using data from the Gaia space telescope\nand elsewhere, we fit models to the GD-1 stream in the presence of a Sgr with\nvarious initial masses. While the best-fitting models do show perturbations\nresulting from interactions with Sgr, we find that the level of disruption is\nnot significantly greater than in the observed stream. To investigate the\ngeneral effects of Sgr on a population of streams, we generate 1000 mock\nstreams on GD-1-like orbits with randomized orientations. Some streams show\nclear evidence of disruption, becoming folded on the sky or developing\nasymmetry betweeen their two tails. However, many survive unaffected and the\npeak surface brightness of stars is decreased by no more than $\sim0.3$\nmag/arcsec$^2$ on average. We conclude that Sgr having an initial mass of\n$\gtrsim4\times10^{10}M_\odot$ is compatible with the survival and detection of\nstreams formed more than 3 Gyr ago.</td>

      <td>Tidally induced spiral arm wraps encoded in phase space</td>
      <td>We study the dynamics of tidally induced spiral arms in our Galaxy in the\ncontext of its encounters with Sagittarius. We built toy models of the\ninteraction between a host and a satellite galaxy using orbital integrations\nafter a tidal encounter. We derived analytically the shape of the structures in\nphase space as a function of time for simple power-law potential models. We\ncompared these models to a more realistic N-body simulation of the MW\nSagittarius-like interaction and to data from Gaia DR3. As found before, an\nimpulsive distant tidal approach of a galactic satellite leads to a two-armed\nspiral structure made of orbits in between their apocentres and pericentres,\nthus, with average negative galactocentric radial velocity. The two-arm pattern\nrotates at an angular speed of $\omega-1/2\kappa$ which depends on radius, thus\ncausing a wind-up with time. This produces ridges in the $R$-$V_\phi$\nprojection with alternating signs of $V_R$ and oscillations of $V_R$ in the\n$L_Z$-$\phi$ space, like those observed in the Gaia data. The frequency of\nthese kinematic features increases with time, offering a powerful means to\ninfer the potential and the perturbation's onset time and azimuthal phase.\nFourier analysis allows us to date the impact times of simple models and even\nto date perturbations from various pericentric passages. For the MW, the\nFourier analysis indicates a superposition of two different frequencies, as in\nprevious studies. Assuming that both are due to impulsive and distant\npericentre passages, we find perturbation times <0.6 Gyr and in the range of\n0.8-2.1 Gyr. The latter is compatible with a previous pericentre of Sagittarius\nand would be related to four wraps of the spiral arms in the observed radial\nrange. Further work on the self-gravitating response of galactic discs and\npossible degeneracies with secular processes by the bar is necessary. (ABR)</td>

The JJ model is a flexible tool for stellar\npopulation synthesis with a fine age resolution of 25 Myr. It includes six\nMilky-Way (MW) components: the four flattened (exponential thin and thick disk,\natomic and molecular gas) and two spheroidal (spherical stellar halo and a\ncored isothermal dark matter sphere). The overall thin-disk thickness is\nassumed to be constant at all radii, though flaring can also be tested. The\nadopted radial variation in the thin-disk star-formation rate (SFR) reflects\nthe inside-out disk growth scenario. We allow a smooth power-law SFR continuum\nto be modified by an arbitrary number of Gaussian peaks. We present a public\ncode of the JJ model complemented by the three sets of isochrones (PARSEC,\nMIST, and BaSTI). Using metallicity distributions of the red clump giants from\nAPOGEE, we constrain the radial variation of the JJ-model age-metallicity\nrelation (AMR) and propose a new analytic form for the AMR function. The\ngeneralised JJ model is a publicly available tool for studying different\nstellar populations across the MW disk. With its fine age resolution and\nflexibility, it can be particularly useful for reconstructing the thin-disk\nSFR, as a variety of different SFR shapes can be constructed within its\nframework.</td>

We\nshow that for the stars likely belonging to the last massive merger, the\n(v_r,r) distribution contains a series of long and thin chevron-like\noverdensities. These phase-space sub-structures are predicted to emerge\nfollowing the dissolution of a satellite, when its tidal debris is given time\nto wind up, thin out and fold. Additionally, the observed energy and angular\nmomentum (E, L_z) distribution appears more prograde at high energies, possibly\nrevealing the original orbital angular momentum of the in-falling galaxy. The\nenergy distribution of the debris is strongly asymmetric with a peak at low E\n-- which, we surmise, may be evidence of the dwarf's rapid sinking -- and\nriddled with wrinkles and bumps. If these small-scale energy inhomogeneities\nhave been seeded during or immediately after the interaction with the Milky\nWay, and are not due to the spatial restriction of our study, then making use\nof the (v_r,r) chevrons to constrain the time of the merger becomes cumbersome.\nNonetheless, we demonstrate that similar phase-space and (E,L_z) sub-structures\nare present in numerical simulations of galaxy interactions, both in bespoke\nN-body runs and in cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in suites. The remnant\ntraces of the progenitor's disruption and the signatures of the on-going\nphase-mixing discovered here will not only help to constrain the properties of\nour Galaxy's most important interaction, but also can be used as a novel tool\nto map out the Milky Way's current gravitational potential and its\nperturbations.</td>

With Gaia DR2 astrometry and\nspectroscopy, we analyze the 3D space velocities of $\sim 1500$ young stars\nalong the Radcliffe Wave in action-angle space, using the motion of the wave's\nnewly born stars as a proxy for its gas motion. We find that the vertical angle\nof young stars -- corresponding to their orbital phase perpendicular to the\nGalactic plane -- varies significantly as a function of position along the\nstructure, in a pattern potentially consistent with a wave-like oscillation.\nThis kind of oscillation is not seen in a control sample of older stars from\nGaia occupying the same volume, disfavouring formation channels caused by\nlong-lived physical processes. We use a ``wavy midplane'' model to try to\naccount for the trend in vertical angles seen in young stars, and find that\nwhile the best-fit parameters for the wave's spatial period and amplitude are\nqualitatively consistent with the existing morphology defined by 3D dust, there\nis no evidence for additional velocity structure. These results support more\nrecent and/or transitory processes in the formation of the Radcliffe Wave,\nwhich would primarily affect the motion of the wave's gaseous material.\nComparisons of our results with new and upcoming simulations, in conjunction\nwith new stellar radial velocity measurements in Gaia DR3, should allow us to\nfurther discriminate between various competing hypotheses.</td>

Focusing on the\ngalaxies themselves, we find that 4/15 have stellar discs which experience\nlarge changes in the orientation of their angular momentum (AM) axes, at rates\nof up to $\sim60$ degrees Gyr$^{-1}$. By calculating the orbital angular\nmomentum axes of the satellites before they are accreted, we show that there is\na tendency for the disc's AM to become more aligned with this axis after the\nmerger. We also investigate the origin of in situ retrograde stars, analogous\nto the 'Splash' in the Milky Way. Tracing them back to earlier snapshots, we\ndemonstrate that they were often disrupted onto their extreme orbits by\nmultiple early mergers.

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey: Motivation, implementation, GIRAFFE data processing, analysis, and final data products</td>
      <td>The Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey is an ambitious project designed to\nobtain astrophysical parameters and elemental abundances for 100,000 stars,\nincluding large representative samples of the stellar populations in the\nGalaxy, and a well-defined sample of 60 (plus 20 archive) open clusters. We\nprovide internally consistent results calibrated on benchmark stars and star\nclusters, extending across a very wide range of abundances and ages. This\nprovides a legacy data set of intrinsic value, and equally a large wide-ranging\ndataset that is of value for homogenisation of other and future stellar surveys\nand Gaia's astrophysical parameters. This article provides an overview of the\nsurvey methodology, the scientific aims, and the implementation, including a\ndescription of the data processing for the GIRAFFE spectra. A companion paper\n(arXiv:2206.02901) introduces the survey results. Gaia-ESO aspires to quantify\nboth random and systematic contributions to measurement uncertainties. Thus all\navailable spectroscopic analysis techniques are utilised, each spectrum being\nanalysed by up to several different analysis pipelines, with considerable\neffort being made to homogenise and calibrate the resulting parameters. We\ndescribe here the sequence of activities up to delivery of processed data\nproducts to the ESO Science Archive Facility for open use. The Gaia-ESO Survey\nobtained 202,000 spectra of 115,000 stars using 340 allocated VLT nights\nbetween December 2011 and January 2018 from GIRAFFE and UVES. The full\nconsistently reduced final data set of spectra was released through the ESO\nScience Archive Facility in late 2020, with the full astrophysical parameters\nsets following in 2022.</td>

      <td>The Chemo-Dynamical Groups of Galactic Globular Clusters</td>
      <td>We introduce a multi-component chemo-dynamical method for splitting the\nGalactic population of Globular Clusters (GCs) into three distinct\nconstituents: bulge, disc, and stellar halo. The latter is further decomposed\ninto the individual large accretion events that built up the Galactic stellar\nhalo: the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, Kraken and Sequoia structures, and the\nSagittarius and Helmi streams. Our modelling is extensively tested using mock\nGC samples constructed from the AURIGA suite of hydrodynamical simulations of\nMilky Way (MW)-like galaxies. We find that, on average, a proportion of the\naccreted GCs cannot be associated with their true infall group and are left\nungrouped, biasing our recovered population numbers to approximately 80 percent\nof their true value. Furthermore, the identified groups have a completeness and\na purity of only 65 percent. This reflects the difficulty of the problem, a\nresult of the large degree of overlap in energy-action space of the debris from\npast accretion events. We apply the method to the Galactic data to infer, in a\nstatistically robust and easily quantifiable way, the GCs associated with each\nMW accretion event. The resulting groups' population numbers of GCs, corrected\nfor biases, are then used to infer the halo and stellar masses of the now\ndefunct satellites that built up the halo of the MW.</td>

      <td>Robust Clustering of the Local Milky Way Stellar Kinematic Substructures with Gaia eDR3</td>
      <td>We apply the clustering algorithm HDBSCAN on the Gaia early third data\nrelease astrometry combined with the Gaia second data release radial velocity\nmeasurements of almost 5.5 million stars to identify the local stellar\nkinematic substructures in the solar neighborhood. Understanding these\nstructures helps build a more complete picture of the formation of the Milky\nWay, as well as an empirical phase space distribution of dark matter that would\ninform detection experiments. The main goal of this study is to provide a list\nof the most stable clusters, by taking into account the measurement\nuncertainties and studying the stability of the clustering results. We apply\nthe clustering algorithm in two spaces, in velocity space in order to study\nrecently accreted structures, and in action-angle space to find phase-mixed\nstructures. We find 23 (6) robust clusters in velocity space (action-angle\nspace) that are consistently not associated with noise. They are attributed to\nthe known structures: the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus, the Helmi Stream, and\nglobular cluster NGC 3201 are found in both spaces, while NGC 104 and the thick\ndisk (Sequoia) are identified in velocity space (action-angle space). We\ndiscuss the kinematic properties of these structures and study whether many of\nthe small clusters belong to a similar larger cluster based on their chemical\nabundances. Although we do not identify any new structures, we find that the\nHDBSCAN member selection of already known structures is unstable to input\nkinematics of the stars when resampled within their uncertainties. We therefore\npresent the most stable subset of local kinematic structures, which are\nconsistently identified by the clustering algorithm, and emphasize the need to\ntake into account error propagation during both the manual and automated\nidentification of stellar structures, both for existing ones as well as future\ndiscoveries.

      <td>The Gaia-ESO survey: placing constraints on the origin of r-process elements</td>
      <td>A renewed interest about the origin of \emph{r}-process elements has been\nstimulated by the multi-messenger observation of the gravitational event\nGW170817, with the detection of both gravitational waves and electromagnetic\nwaves corresponding to the merger of two neutron stars. Such phenomenon has\nbeen proposed as one of the main sources of the \emph{r}-process. However, the\norigin of the \emph{r}-process elements at different metallicities is still\nunder debate. We aim at investigating the origin of the \emph{r}-process\nelements in the Galactic thin disc population. From the sixth internal data\nrelease of the \emph{Gaia}-ESO we have collected a large sample of Milky Way\nthin- and thick-disc stars for which abundances of Eu, O, and Mg are available.\nThe sample consists of members of 62 open clusters, located at a Galactocentric\nradius from $\sim 5$ kpc to $\sim 20$ kpc in the disc, in the metallicity range\n$[-0.5, 0.4]$ and covering an age interval from 0.1 to 7 Gy, and about 1300\nMilky Way disc field stars in the metallicity range $[-1.5, 0.5]$. We compare\nthe observations with the results of a chemical evolution model, in which we\nvaried the nucleosynthesis sources for the three considered elements. Our main\nresult is that Eu in the thin disc is predominantly produced by sources with\nshort lifetimes, such as magneto-rotationally driven SNe. There is no strong\nevidence for additional sources at delayed times. Our findings do not imply\nthat there cannot be a contribution from mergers of neutron stars in other\nenvironments, as in the halo or in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, but such a\ncontribution is not needed to explain Eu abundances at thin disc metallicities.</td>

      <td>From ridges to manifolds: 3D characterization of the moving groups in the Milky Way disc</td>
      <td>The stellar velocity distribution in the Solar Neighbourhood displays\nkinematic substructures, which are possibly signatures of the bar and spiral\narms of the Milky Way and of previous accretion events. These kinematic\nsubstructures -- moving groups -- can be thought of as continuous manifolds in\nthe 6D phase space, and the ridges in the $V_{\phi}-R$ and arches in the\n$V_\phi-V_R$ plane, discovered with the Gaia mission, as projections of these\nmanifolds. We develop and apply a methodology to perform a blind search for\nsubstructure in the Gaia EDR3 6D data, and obtain a sampling of the manifolds.\nThe method consists in the execution of the Wavelet Transform in small volumes\nof the Milky Way disc, and the grouping of these local solutions into global\nones with a method based on the Breadth-first search algorithm from Graph\nTheory. We reveal the complex skeleton of the velocity distribution, sampling\nnine main moving groups in a large region of the disc ($6$ kpc, $60$ deg, and\n$2$ kpc in the radial, azimuthal, and vertical directions). In the radial\ndirection, the groups deviate from lines of constant angular momentum that one\nwould naively expect from first order effect of resonances. The azimuthal\nvelocity of Acturus, Bobylev, and Hercules is non-axisymmetric. For Hercules,\nwe measure an azimuthal gradient of $-0.50$ km/s/deg at $R=8$ kpc. We detect a\nvertical asymmetry in the azimuthal velocity for Coma Berenices, which is not\nexpected in a resonance of the bar, supporting previous hypothesis of\nincomplete vertical phase-mixing. When we apply the same methodology to\nsimulations of barred galaxies, we extract substructures corresponding to the\nOuter Linbdlad and the 1:1 Resonances and observe patterns consistent with the\ndata. This data-driven characterization allows for a quantitative comparison\nwith models, providing a key tool to comprehend the dynamics of the Milky Way.\n(Abridged)</td>

      <td>Multiple phase spirals suggest multiple origins in Gaia DR3</td>
      <td>{\it Gaia} Data Release 2 (DR2) revealed that the Milky Way contains\nsignificant indications of departures from equilibrium in the form of\nasymmetric features in the phase space density of stars in the Solar\nneighborhood. One such feature is the $z$--$v_z$ phase spiral, interpreted as\nthe response of the disk to the influence of a perturbation perpendicular to\nthe disk plane, which could be external (e.g., a satellite) or internal (e.g.,\nthe bar or spiral arms). In this work we use {\it Gaia} DR3 to dissect the\nphase spiral by dividing the local data set into groups with similar azimuthal\nactions, $J_\phi$, and conjugate angles, $\theta_\phi$, which selects stars on\nsimilar orbits and at similar orbital phases, thus having experienced similar\nperturbations in the past. These divisions allow us to explore areas of the\nGalactic disk larger than the surveyed region. The separation improves the\nclarity of the $z$--$v_z$ phase spiral and exposes changes to its morphology\nacross the different action-angle groups. In particular, we discover a\ntransition to two armed `breathing spirals' in the inner Milky Way. We conclude\nthat the local data contains signatures of not one, but multiple perturbations\nwith the prospect to use their distinct properties to infer the properties of\nthe interactions that caused them.</td>

      <td>Radial velocities from far red spectra of Carina Arm O and early B stars</td>
      <td>Massive O and early B stars are important markers of recent star formation\nand exert a significant influence on their environments during their short\nlives via photoionization and winds and when they explode as supernovae. In the\nMilky Way they can be detected at great distances but often lie behind large\ndust columns, making detection at short wavelengths difficult. In this study\nthe use of the less extinguished far-red spectrum (8400 -- 8800 \AA ) for\nradial velocity measurement is examined. Results are reported for a sample of\n164 confirmed OB stars within a 2-degree field positioned on the Carina Arm.\nMost stars are at distances between 3 and 6 kpc, and Westerlund 2 is at the\nfield edge. The measured radial velocities have errors concentrated in the\n3--10 km s$^{-1}$ range, with a systematic uncertainty of 2--3 km s$^{-1}$.\nThese are combined with Gaia-mission astrometry to allow full space motions to\nbe constructed. Up to 22 stars are likely to be runaways although 8 of them are\nas likely to be interloping (so far undetected) binaries. The mean azimuthal\nmotion of the sample fits in with recent measurements of Galactic disk\nrotation. In the Galactocentric radial direction the mean motion indicates\nmodest infall at a speed of $\sim$ 10 km s$^{-1}$. This experiment shows that\nweak Paschen lines in the far-red can yield credible radial velocity\ndetermination, offering the prospect of exploring OB-star kinematics over much\nmore of the Galactic disk than has hitherto been possible.</td>

      <td>LAMOST meets Gaia: The Galactic Open Clusters</td>
      <td>Open Clusters are born and evolve along the Milky Way plane, on them is\nimprinted the history of the Galactic disc, including the chemical and\ndynamical evolution. Chemical and dynamical properties of open clusters can be\nderived from photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric data of their member\nstars. Based on the photometric and astrometric data from the Gaia mission, the\nmembership of stars in more than 2000 Galactic clusters has been identified in\nthe literature. The chemical and kinematical properties, however, are still\npoorly known for many of these clusters. In synergy with the large\nspectroscopic survey LAMOST (data release 8) and Gaia (data release 2), we\nreport a new comprehensive catalogue of 386 open clusters. This catalogue has\nhomogeneous parameter determinations of radial velocity, metallicity, and\ndynamical properties, such as orbit, eccentricity, angular momenta, total\nenergy, and 3D Galactic velocity. These parameters allow the first radial\nvelocity determination and the first spectroscopic [Fe/H] determination for 44\nand 137 clusters, respectively. The metallicity distribution of majority\nclusters shows falling trends in the parameter space of the Galactocentric\nradius, the total energy, and the Z component of angular momentum -- except for\ntwo old groups that show flat tails in their own parameter planes. Cluster\npopulations of ages younger and older than 500 Myrs distribute diversely on the\ndisc. The latter has a spatial consistency with the Galactic disc flare. The\n3-D spatial comparison between very young clusters (< 100 Myr) and nearby\nmolecular clouds revealed a wide range of metallicity distribution along the\nRadcliffe gas cloud wave, indicating a possible inhomogeneous mixing or fast\nstar formation along the wave. This catalogue would serve the community as a\nuseful tool to trace the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Milky Way.</td>

We train the network on the target galaxy's own local\nenvironment defined by the stellar halo and the surviving satellites. We\ndemonstrate that this approach allows the detection of accreted stars that are\nspatially mixed into the disc. Two performance measures are defined - recovery\nfraction of accreted stars, and the probability that a star with a positive\n(accreted) classification is a true-positive result, P(TP). As the NNM output\nis akin to an assigned probability, we are able to determine positivity based\non flexible threshold values that can be adjusted easily to refine the\nselection of presumed-accreted stars. We find that GANN identifies accreted\ndisc stars within simulated galaxies, with high recovery fraction and/or high\nP(TP). We also find that stars in Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) mass systems are\nover 50% recovered by our NNMs in the majority (18/24) of cases. Additionally,\nnearly every individual source of accreted stars is detected at 10% or more of\nits peak stellar mass in the disc. We also demonstrate that a conglomerated\nNNM, trained on the halo and satellite stars from all of the Auriga galaxies\nprovides the most consistent results, and could prove to be an intriguing\nfuture approach as our observational capabilities expand.</td>

We find that\nthe local stellar halo contains 7 main dynamical groups, some of in-situ and\nsome of accreted origin, most of which are already known. We report the\ndiscovery of a new substructure, which we name ED-1. In addition, we find\nevidence for 11 independent smaller clumps, 5 of which are new: ED-2, 3, 4, 5\nand 6 are typically rather tight dynamically, depict a small range of\nmetallicities, and their abundances when available, as well as their location\nin Integrals of Motion space, suggest an accreted origin.

The samples are LAMOST and SDSS/SEGUE K giants (KG) and SDSS/SEGUE\nblue horizontal branch (BHB) stars with accurate metallicities. The 3D\nkinematics are available through LAMOST and SDSS/SEGUE distances and radial\nvelocities and {\it Gaia} DR2 proper motions. Two methods are used to estimate\nthe enclosed mass: 3D spherical Jeans equation and Evans et al. tracer mass\nestimator (TME). We remove substructure via the Xue et al. method based on\nintegrals of motion. We evaluate the uncertainties on our estimates due to\nrandom sampling noise, systematic distance errors, the adopted density profile,\nand non-virialization and non-spherical effects of the halo. The tracer density\nprofile remains a limiting systematic in our mass estimates, although within\nthese limits we find reasonable agreement across the different samples and the\nmethods applied.

      <td>Evidence for C and Mg variations in the GD-1 stellar stream</td>
      <td>Dynamically cold stellar streams are the relics left over from globular\ncluster dissolution. These relics offer a unique insight into a now fully\ndisrupted population of ancient clusters in our Galaxy. Using a combination of\nGaia eDR3 proper motions, optical and near-UV colours we select a sample of\nlikely Red Giant Branch stars from the GD-1 stream for medium-low resolution\nspectroscopic follow-up. Based on radial velocity and metallicity, we are able\nto find 14 new members of GD-1, 5 of which are associated with the \emph{spur}\nand \emph{blob/cocoon} off-stream features. We measured C-abundances to probe\nfor abundance variations known to exist in globular clusters. These variations\nare expected to manifest in a subtle way in globular clusters with such low\nmasses ($\sim10^4 {\rm ~M_{\odot}}$) and metallicities (${\rm[Fe/H]}\sim-2.1\n{\rm ~dex}$). We find that the C-abundances of the stars in our sample display\na small but significant ($ 3\sigma$ level) spread. Furthermore, we find $\sim\n3\sigma$ variation in Mg-abundances among the stars in our sample that have\nbeen observed by APOGEE. These abundance patterns match the ones found in\nGalactic globular clusters of similar metallicity. Our results suggest that\nGD-1 represents another fully disrupted low mass globular cluster where\nlight-element abundance spreads have been found.</td>

Both of the clusters are investigated by\ncombining data sets from Gaia EDR3 and CCD UBV observational data. Analysis of\nthe radial distribution of stars through the cluster regions indicates that the\ncluster limit radii are $r_{\rm lim}=8'$ for both of the clusters. We determine\nthe membership probabilities of stars considering Gaia EDR3 proper motion and\ntrigonometric parallax data, resulting in 361 stars in NGC 1193 and 428 in NGC\n1798 being identified as most likely cluster members, having membership\nprobabilities greater than P>0.5. Mean proper motion components are estimated\nas ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos \delta$, $\mu_{\delta}) = (-0.207(0.009), -0.431(0.008)$)\nfor NGC 1193 and ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos \delta$, $\mu_{\delta})=(0.793(0.006),\n-0.373(0.005)$) mas/yr for NGC 1798. E(B-V) color excesses were derived for NGC\n1193 as $0.150(0.037)$ and for NGC 1798 as 0.505(0.100) mag through the use of\ntwo-color diagrams. Photometric metallicities are also determined from\ntwo-color diagrams with the results of [Fe/H] = -0.30(0.06) dex for NGC 1193\nand [Fe/H]=-0.20(0.07) dex for NGC 1798. The isochrone fitting distance and age\nof NGC 1193 are 5562(381) pc and 4.6(1) Gyr, respectively. For NGC 1798, these\nparameters are 4451(728) pc and 1.3(0.2) Gyr. These ages indicate that NGC 1193\nand NGC 1798 are old open clusters. The overall present-day mass function\nslopes for main-sequence stars are found as 1.38(2.16) for NGC 1193 and\n1.30(0.21) for NGC 1798, which are in fair agreement with the value of Salpeter\n(1955). Kinematic and dynamic orbital calculations indicate that NGC 1193 and\nNGC 1798 belong to the thick-disk and thin-disk populations, respectively. In\naddition, both of the clusters were born outside the solar circle, and both\norbit in the metal-poor region of the Galactic disk.</td>

      <td>Investigating a predicted metallicity [Fe/H] variation in the Type II Globular Cluster NGC 362</td>
      <td>NGC 362 is a non-common Type II Galactic globular cluster, showing a complex\npseudo two-color diagram or 'chromosome map'. The clear separation of its\nstellar populations in the color-magnitude diagram and the distribution of the\ngiant stars in the chromosome map strongly suggests that NGC 362 could host\nstars with both cluster-nominal as well as enhanced heavy-element abundances,\nand one of them could be iron. However, despite previous spectroscopic\nobservations of NGC 362, no such iron variation has been detected. Our main\ngoal is to confirm or disprove this result by searching for any internal\nvariation of [Fe/H] which would give us insight into the formation and\nevolution of this interesting globular cluster. In this paper, we present the\nabundance analysis for a sample of 11 red giant branch members based on\nhigh-resolution and high S/N spectra obtained with the MIKE echelle\nspectrograph mounted at the Magellan-Clay telescope. HST and GAIA photometry\nand astrometry has been used to determine atmospheric parameters and\nmembership. We obtained T$_{\text{eff}}$, log(g) and v$_{\text{t}}$ for our\ntarget stars and measured the mean iron content of the sample and its\ndispersion with three different methods, which lead to\n[Fe/H]$_1$=-1.10$\pm0.02$, [Fe/H]$_2$=-1.09$\pm0.01$ and\n[Fe/H]$_3$=-1.10$\pm0.01$, while the internal dispersion turned out to be\n$\sigma_{[\text{Fe/H}]_1}$=0.06$\pm0.01$,\n$\sigma_{[\text{Fe/H}]_2}$=0.03$\pm0.01$ and\n$\sigma_{[\text{Fe/H}]_3}$=0.05$\pm0.01$ respectively. The error analysis gives\nan internal dispersion due to observational error of 0.05 dex. Comparing the\nobserved dispersion with the internal errors, we conclude that NGC 362 does not\nshow any trace of an internal iron spread.</td>

We assume that the Galaxy is in equilibrium and is\nsymmetric about both the spin axis of the disk and the Galactic midplane. The\npotential is taken as a sum of terms that nominally represent contributions\nfrom the gas disk, stellar disk, bulge, and dark matter halo.

The DF for each component is described by an analytic function of the\nenergy, the spin angular momentum, and the vertical energy, in accord with\nJeans theorem. We present model predictions for the radial and vertical forces\nwithin $\sim 2\,{\rm kpc}$ of the Sun, highlighting the rotation curve and\nvertical force profile in the Solar Neighbourhood. Finally, we show residuals\nfor star counts in the $R-z$ and $z-v_z$ planes as well as maps of the mean\nradial and azimuthal velocities in the $z-v_z$ plane. Using our model for the\npotential, we also examine the star count residuals in action-frequency-angle\ncoordinates.

      <td>The unusually large "dwarf" galaxy Crater II, with its small velocity\ndispersion, $\simeq 3$ km/s, defies expectations that low mass galaxies should\nbe small and dense. We combine the latest stellar and velocity dispersion\nprofiles finding Crater II has a prominent dark core of radius $\simeq\n0.71^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$ kpc, surrounded by a low density halo, with a transition\nvisible between the core and the halo. We show that this profile matches the\ndistinctive core-halo profile predicted by "Wave Dark Matter" as a\nBose-Einstein condensate, $\psi$DM, where the ground state soliton core is\nsurrounded by a tenuous halo of interfering waves, with a marked density\ntransition predicted between the core and halo. Similar core-halo structure is\nseen in most dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph), but with smaller cores, $\simeq\n0.25$ kpc and higher velocity dispersions, $\simeq 9$km/s, and we argue here\nthat Crater II may have been a typical dSph that has lost most of its halo mass\nto tidal stripping, so its velocity dispersion is lower by a factor of 3 and\nthe soliton is wider by a factor of 3, following the inverse scaling required\nby the Uncertainty Principle. This tidal solution for Crater II in the context\nof $\psi$DM, is supported by its small pericenter of $\simeq 20$ kpc\nestablished by Gaia, implying significant tidal stripping of Crater II by the\nMilky Way is expected.</td>

We determined stellar parameters from\nGaia photometry and parallaxes. Chemical abundances were derived using spectrum\nsynthesis and model atmospheres.Results. We determined chemical abundances of\n26 species of 18 elements: Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,\nCu, Zn, Sr, Y, and Zr. For several stars, we were able to measure both neutral\nand ionised species, including Si, Sc, Mn, and Zr. We have roughly doubled the\nnumber of measurements of Cu for stars at [Fe/H] <= -2.5. The homogeneity of\nthe sample made it possible to highlight the presence of two Zn-rich stars\n([Zn/Fe]~+0.7), one r-rich and the other r-poor. We report the existence of two\nbranches in the [Zn/Fe] versus [Ni/Fe] plane and suggest that the high [Zn/Fe]\nbranch is the result of hypernova nucleosynthesis. We discovered two stars with\npeculiar light neutron-capture abundance patterns: CES1237+1922 (also known as\nBS 16085-0050), which is ~1 dex underabundant in Sr, Y, and Zr with respect to\nthe other stars in the sample, and CES2250-4057 (also known as HE 2247-4113),\nwhich shows a ~1 dex overabundance of Sr with respect to Y and Zr.Conclusions.\nThe high quality of our dataset allowed us to measure hardly detectable ions.\nThis can provide guidance in the development of line formation computations\nthat take deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium and hydrodynamical\neffects into account.</td>

      <td>M54 is a prototype of a globular cluster embedded in a dark matter halo. Gaia\nEDR3 photometry and proper motions separate the old, metal-poor stars from the\nmore metal rich and younger dwarf galaxy stars. The metal poor stars dominate\nthe inner 50 pc, with a velocity dispersion profile that declines to a minimum\naround 30 pc then rises back to nearly the central velocity dispersion, as\nexpected for a globular cluster at the center of a dark matter halo. The Jeans\nanalysis of the three separate stellar populations give consistent masses that\nrise approximately linearly with radius to 1 kpc, implying a small core or\ncuspy halo. These data are compatible with an infalling CDM dark matter halo\nreduced to 3x10^8 M_sun at the 50 kpc apocenter 2.3 Gyr ago, with a central\nglobular cluster surrounded by the remnant of a dwarf galaxy. Tides gradually\nremove material beyond 1 kpc but have little effect on the stars and dark\nmatter within 300 pc of the center. M54 appears to be a transitional system\nbetween globular clusters with and without local dark halos, whose evolution\nwithin the galaxy depends sensitively on the time of accretion and orbital\npericenter.</td>

      <td>We investigate the structure of our Galaxy's young stellar disc by fitting\nthe distribution functions (DFs) of a new family to five-dimensional Gaia data\nfor a sample of $47\,000$ OB stars. Tests of the fitting procedure show that\nthe young disc's DF would be strongly constrained by Gaia data if the\ndistribution of Galactic dust were accurately known. The DF that best fits the\nreal data accurately predicts the kinematics of stars at their observed\nlocations, but it predicts the spatial distribution of stars poorly, almost\ncertainly on account of errors in the best-available dust map. We argue that\ndust models could be greatly improved by modifying the dust model until the\nspatial distribution of stars predicted by a DF agreed with the data. The\nsurface density of OB stars is predicted to peak at $R\simeq5.5\mbox{kpc}$,\nslightly outside the reported peak in the surface density of molecular gas; we\nsuggest that the latter radius may have been under-estimated through the use of\npoor kinematic distances. The velocity distributions predicted by the best-fit\nDF for stars with measured line-of-sight velocities $v_\parallel$ reveal that\nthe outer disc is disturbed at the level of 10 $\mbox{km}~\mbox{s}^{-1}$ in\nagreement with earlier studies, and that the measured values of $v_\parallel$\nhave significant contributions from the orbital velocities of binaries. Hence\nthe outer disc is colder than it is sometimes reported to be.</td>

      <td>The Blanco DECam Bulge Survey (BDBS) has imaged more than 200 square degrees\nof the southern Galactic bulge, providing photometry in the ugrizy filters for\n$\sim 250$ million unique stars. The presence of a strong foreground disk\npopulation, along with complex reddening and extreme image crowding, has made\nit difficult to constrain the presence of young and intermediate age stars in\nthe bulge population. We employed an accurate cross-match of BDBS with the\nlatest data release (EDR3) from the Gaia mission, matching more than 140\nmillion sources with BDBS photometry and Gaia EDR3 photometry and astrometry.\nWe relied on Gaia EDR3 astrometry, without any photometric selection, to\nproduce clean BDBS bulge colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Gaia parallaxes were\nused to filter out bright foreground sources, and a Gaussian mixture model fit\nto Galactic proper motions could identify stars kinematically consistent with\nbulge membership. We applied this method to 127 different bulge fields of $1$\ndeg$^2$ each, with $|\ell| \leq 9.5^\circ$ and $-9.5^\circ \leq b \leq\n-2.5^\circ$. The astrometric cleaning procedure removes the majority of blue\nstars in each field, especially near the Galactic plane, where the ratio of\nblue to red stars is $\lesssim 10\%$, increasing to values $\sim 20\%$ at\nhigher Galactic latitudes. We rule out the presence of a widespread population\nof stars younger than 2 Gyr. The vast majority of blue stars brighter than the\nturnoff belong to the foreground population, according to their measured\nastrometry. We introduce the distance between the observed red giant branch\nbump and the red clump as a simple age proxy for the dominant population in the\nfield, and we confirm the picture of a predominantly old bulge. Further work is\nneeded to apply the method to estimate ages to fields at higher latitudes, and\nto model the complex morphology of the Galactic bulge.</td>

We use the combined 6-dimensional phase\nspace information to search for hypervelocity stars (HVSs), unbound stars\naccelerated by dynamical processes happening in the Galactic Centre. By looking\nat the kinematics of Gaia DR3 stars in Galactocentric coordinates and by\nintegrating their orbits in the Galactic potential, we do not identify any HVS\ncandidates with a velocity higher than $700$ km s$^{-1}$ and robustly observed\nkinematics. Assuming a scenario wherein the interaction between a stellar\nbinary and the massive black hole Sgr A$^*$ is responsible for HVS ejections\nfrom the Galactic Centre, we derive degenerate limits on the ejection rate of\nHVSs and the slope of the initial mass function of the primary star among\nbinaries in the Galactic Centre. Our results indicate that the HVS ejection\nrate is $\lesssim 8\times10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ assuming a Salpeter mass function,\nand this upper limit becomes progressively smaller for an increasingly\ntop-heavy mass distribution. A fiducial HVS ejection rate of $10^{-4}$\nyr$^{-1}$ prefers a mass function slope $\lesssim -2.35$, disfavouring\npreviously claimed top-heavy initial mass functions among stars in the Galactic\nCentre.</td>

      <td>The Atari Disk, a Metal-Poor Stellar Population in the Disk System of the Milky Way</td>
      <td>We have developed a chemo-dynamical approach to assign 36,010 metal-poor\nSkyMapper stars to various Galactic stellar populations. Using two independent\ntechniques (velocity and action space behavior), $Gaia$ EDR3 astrometry, and\nphotometric metallicities, we selected stars with the characteristics of the\n"metal-weak" thick disk population by minimizing contamination by the canonical\nthick disk or other Galactic structures. This sample comprises 7,127 stars,\nspans a metallicity range of $-3.50<${\metal}~$<-0.8$, and has a systematic\nrotational velocity of $\langle V_\phi\rangle=154$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ that lags that\nof the thick disk. Orbital eccentricities have intermediate values between\ntypical thick disk and halo values. The scale length is\n$h_{R}=2.48^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$\,kpc and the scale height is\n$h_{Z}=1.68^{+0.19}_{-0.15}$\,kpc. The metallicity distribution function is\nwell fit by an exponential with a slope of $\Delta\log{\rm\nN}/\Delta\metal=1.13\pm0.06$. Overall, we find a significant metal-poor\ncomponent consisting of 261 SkyMapper stars with \metal$<-2.0$. While our\nsample contains only eleven stars with {\metal}~$\lesssim-3.0$, investigating\nthe JINAbase compilation of metal-poor stars reveals another 18 such stars\n(five have {\metal}$<-4.0$) that kinematically belong to our sample. These\ndistinct spatial, kinematic and chemical characteristics strongly suggest this\nmetal-poor, phase-mixed kinematic sample to represent an independent disk\ncomponent with an accretion origin in which a massive dwarf galaxy radially\nplunged into the early Galactic disk. Going forward, we propose to call the\nmetal-weak thick disk population as the Atari disk, given its likely accretion\norigin, and in reference to it sharing space with the Galactic thin and thick\ndisks.</td>

      <td>Gaia DR3 provides radial velocities for 33 million stars and\nspectroscopically derived atmospheric parameters for more than five million\ntargets. When combined with the astrometric data, these allow us to derive\norbital and stellar parameters that are key in order to understand the stellar\npopulations of the Milky Way and perform galactic archaeology. We use the\ncalibrated atmospheric parameters, 2MASS and Gaia-EDR3 photometry, and\nparallax-based distances to compute, via an isochrone fitting method, the ages,\ninitial stellar masses and reddenings for the stars with spectroscopic\nparameters. We also derive the orbits (actions, eccentricities, apocentre,\npericentre and Zmax) for all of the stars with measured radial velocities and\nastrometry, adopting two sets of line-of-sight distances from the literature\nand an axisymmetric potential of the Galaxy. Comparisons with reference\ncatalogues of field and cluster stars suggest that reliable ages are obtained\nfor stars younger than 9-10Gyr when the estimated relative age uncertainty is\n<50%. For older stars, ages tend to be under-estimated. The most reliable\nstellar type for age determination are turn-off stars, even when the input\natmospheric parameters have large uncertainties. Ages for giants and\nmain-sequence stars are retrieved with uncertainties of ~2Gyr when extinction\ntowards the star's line-of sight is smaller than A_V<2.5mag. The full catalogue\nis made publicly available to be downloaded. With it, the full chemo-dynamical\nproperties of the extended Solar neighbourhood unfold, and allow us to better\nidentify the properties of the spiral arms, to parameterise the dynamical\nheating of the disc, or to thoroughly study the chemical enrichment of the\nMilky Way.</td>

An additional excess of halo stars with\nlow velocity and metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.5 could be associated with the\nshell of a lower energy RME or indicate that lower energy halo stars have\nhigher metallicity.

In the optical bands, GCs\nappear to have colours that are only slightly different from stars. The\ninclusion of archival IRAC data yields dramatic improvements in colour\nseparation, as the long wavelength baseline aids somewhat in the separation\nfrom stars and clearly separates GCs from many compact background galaxies. We\nshow that some previously spectroscopically-identified GCs in the M81 group are\ninstead foreground stars or background galaxies. GCs close to M82 have radial\nvelocities suggesting that they fell into the M81 group along with M82. The\noverall M81 GC luminosity function is similar to the Milky Way and M31. M81's\nouter halo GCs are similar to the Milky Way in their metallicities and numbers,\nand much less numerous than M31's more metal-rich outer halo GC population.\nThese properties reflect differences in the three galaxies' merger histories,\nhighlighting the possibility of using outer halo GCs to trace merger history in\nlarger samples of galaxies.</td>

      <td>Globular clusters being old and densely packed serve as ideal laboratories to\ntest stellar evolution theories. Although there is enormous literature on\nglobular clusters in optical bands, studies in the ultraviolet (UV) regime are\nsparse. In this work, we study the stellar populations of a metal poor and a\nrather dispersed globular cluster, NGC 5053, using the UV instrument of\nAstroSat, namely the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope in three far-UV (F154W,\nF169M, F172M) and three near-UV (N219M, N245M, N263M) filters. Photometry was\ncarried out on these images to construct a catalogue of UV stars, of which the\ncluster members were identified using Gaia EDR3 catalogue. UV and optical CMDs\nhelp us locate known stellar populations such as BHB stars, RR-Lyrae stars, RHB\nstars, BSSs, SX-Phe, RGB and AGB stars. Based on their locations in the CMDs,\nwe have identified 8 new BSS candidates, 6 probable eBSSs, and an EHB\ncandidate. Their nature has been confirmed by fitting their spectral energy\ndistributions with stellar atmospheric models. We believe the BSS population of\nthis cluster is likely to have a collisional origin based on our analyses of\ntheir radial distribution and SEDs. BaSTI-IAC isochrones were generated to\ncharacterize the cluster properties, and we find that the observed brightness\nand colours of cluster members are best-fit with a model that is alpha-enhanced\nwith a helium fraction of 0.247, metallicity of -1.9 dex and age within a range\nof 10.5-14.5 Gyr.</td>

We\nselected the extra-tidal candidates based on their angular distances from the\ncluster centre in the RA-Dec plane, proper motions of the clusters and the\nindividual extra-tidal star candidates, and their positions on the\ncolour-magnitude diagrams of the clusters. We found extra-tidal candidates for\nthe nine studied GCs. For eight of them, the surface density of candidate\nextra-tidal stars in the vicinity of the clusters is in significant excess with\nrespect to more distant surrounding fields. No extended extra-tidal features\nbeyond 5 tidal radii were detected for any of the clusters. We publish a list\nof the most probable extra-tidal candidates that we determined using Gaia\nastrometric and photometric data. Our analysis shows that the clusters that are\nassociated with Sgr dSph are more likely affected by the gravitational\npotential of the Sgr, as the distribution of extra-tidal stars is elongated in\nthe same direction as the local stream. NGC 4147 is the only exception. We\nfound some high-probability candidate extra-tidal stars in several of the\nanalysed clusters.

The\nadvent of the ESA astrometric satellite Gaia has enabled the detection of\ncompletely new structures in the halo such as the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage.\nHowever, simulations also show that mergers may be important for the build-up\nof the cool stellar disks. Combining elemental abundances for 100 giant branch\nstars from APOGEE DR17 and astrometric data from Gaia we use elemental\nabundance ratios to find an hitherto unknown, old stellar component in the cool\nstellar disk in the Milky Way.

From these DFs plus a specified\ndistribution of gas, we solve for the densities of stars and dark matter and\nthe potential they generate. The principal observational constraints are the\nkinematics of stars with Gaia RVS data and the density of stars in the column\nabove the Sun. The model predicts the density and kinematics of stars and dark\nmatter throughout the Galaxy. We determine the structure of the dark halo prior\nto the infall of baryons. A simple extension of the DFs of stellar components\nto include chemistry allows the model to reproduce the way the Galaxy's\nchemistry is observed to vary in the (R,z) plane. Surprisingly, the data\nindicate that high-alpha stars are confined to orbits with J_z >~ 50 kpc km/s.\nThe code used to create the model is available on Github.</td>

Our MAMPOSSt-PM fits\nstrongly prefer an extended DCM in NGC 6397, while only presenting a mild\npreference for it in NGC 3201, with respective sizes of a roughly one and a few\nper cent of the cluster effective radius. We explore the astrophysics behind\nour results with the CMC Monte Carlo N-body code, whose snapshots best matching\nthe phase space observations lead to similar values for the mass and size of\nthe DCM.

Methods: We use data from Gaia EDR3 extended with radial\nvelocities from ground-based spectroscopic surveys to construct a sample of\nhalo stars within 2.5 kpc from the Sun. We apply a hierarchical clustering\nmethod that uses the single linkage algorithm in a 3D space defined by the\ncommonly used integrals of motion energy $E$, together with two components of\nthe angular momentum, $L_z$ and $L_\perp$. To evaluate the statistical\nsignificance of the clusters found, we compare the density within an\nellipsoidal region centered on the cluster to that of random sets with similar\nglobal dynamical properties. We pick out the signal at the location of their\nmaximum statistical significance in the hierarchical tree. We estimate the\nproximity of a star to the cluster center using the Mahalanobis distance. We\nalso apply the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm in velocity space. Results: Our\nprocedure identifies 67 highly significant clusters ($ > 3\sigma$), containing\n12\% of the sources in our halo set, and in total 232 subgroups or individual\nstreams in velocity space. In total, 13.8\% of the stars in our data set can be\nconfidently associated to a significant cluster based on their Mahalanobis\ndistance. Inspection of our data set reveals a complex web of relationships\nbetween the significant clusters, suggesting that they can be tentatively\ngrouped into at least 6 main structures, many of which can be associated to\npreviously identified halo substructures, and a number of independent\nsubstructures.

With this 6D catalogue of stars with positions, distances,\nline-of-sight velocity, and $Gaia$ proper motions, we were able to identify\nstars belonging to the Cetus stellar stream in the integrals of motion space.\nGuided by the properties we derived for the Cetus stream from this 6D sample,\nwe searched for additional stars from the blue horizontal and from the red\ngiant branches in a 5D sample. We find that the Cetus stream and the Palca\noverdensity are actually two parts of the same structure, which therefore we\npropose to rename the Cetus-Palca stream. We found that the Cetus-Palca stream\nhas a stellar mass of $\simeq 1.5 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$ and presents a\nprominent distance gradient of 15 kpc over the $\sim 100 \deg$ that it covers\non the sky. Additionally, we also report the discovery of a second structure,\nalmost parallel to the Cetus stream, covering $\sim 50 \deg$ of the sky, that\ncould potentially be a stellar stream formed by the tidal disruption of a\nglobular cluster that was orbiting around the Cetus stream progenitor.</td>

      <td>The VISTA Variables in the Via L\'actea Extended Survey (VVVX) allows probing\npreviously unexplored regions of the inner Milky Way (MW). We are looking for\nnew candidate globular clusters (GCs), with the aim of completing the census of\nthe MW GC system. We searched and characterised new GCs, using a combination of\nthe near-IR VVVX survey and 2MASS datasets, and the optical Gaia EDR3\nphotometry and its precise proper motions (PMs). We report the discovery of a\nnew Galactic GC, named Garro 02, situated at RA=18:05:51.1, Dec=-17:42:02 and\nl=12.042 deg, b=+1.656 deg. Performing a PM-decontamination procedure, we built\na final catalogue with all cluster members, on which we performed a photometric\nanalysis. We calculated a reddening of $E(J-K_s)=1.07\pm 0.06$ mag and\nextinction of $A_{Ks}=0.79\pm 0.04$ mag in the near-IR; while $E(BP-RP)=2.40\pm\n0.01$ mag and $A_{G}=4.80\pm 0.02$ mag in optical passbands. Its heliocentric\ndistance is $D=5.6\pm 0.8$ kpc, which places Garro 02 at a Galactocentric\ndistance of $R_G=2.9$ kpc and Z=0.006 kpc above the Galactic plane. We\nestimated the metallicity and age by comparison with known GCs and by fitting\nPARSEC isochrones, finding [Fe/H]$=-1.30\pm 0.2$ dex and age=$12\pm 2$ Gyr. We\nderived the mean cluster PM of $(\mu_{\alpha}^{\ast}, \mu_{\delta}) = (-6.07\pm\n0.62, -6.15\pm 0.75)$ mas yr$^{-1}$. We calculated the cluster luminosity in\nthe near-IR of $M_{Ks}=-7.52\pm 1.23$ mag, which is equivalent to $M_{V}=-5.44$\nmag. The core and tidal radii from the radial density profile are $r_c =1.25\pm\n0.27$ arcmin (2.07 pc) and $r_t = 7.13\pm 3.83$ arcmin (11.82 pc),\nrespectively. We confirm Garro 02 as a new genuine Galactic GC, located in the\nMW bulge. It is a low-luminosity, metal-poor, and old GC, and it is a lucky\nsurvivor of the strong dynamical processes that occurred during the MW's entire\nlife.</td>

The data are obtained by combining the relative VVV\nInfrared Astrometric Catalog v1 proper motions with the Gaia DR2 absolute\nreference frame. We undertake a comprehensive analysis of the various errors in\nour comparison, from both the data and the models, and allow for additional,\nunknown, contributions by using an outlier-tolerant likelihood function to\nevaluate the best fitting model. We quantify systematic effects such as the\nregion of data included in the comparison, the possible overlap from spiral\narms, and the choice of synthetic luminosity function and bar angle used to\npredict the data from the models. Resulting variations in the best-fit\nparameters are included in their final errors. We thus measure the bar pattern\nspeed to be ${\Omega}_b=33.29\pm1.81 \mathrm{km \, s^{-1} \, kpc^{-1}}$ and the\nazimuthal solar velocity to be $V_{\phi,\,\odot} = 251.31 \pm 1.95 \mathrm{km\n\, s^{-1}}$. These values, when combined with recent measurements of the\nGalactic rotation curve, yield the distance of corotation, 6.5 < $R_{CR}$ [kpc]\n< 7.5, the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR), 10.7 < $R_{OLR}$ [kpc] < 12.4, and\nthe higher order, m = 4, OLR, 8.7 < $R_{{OLR}_4}$ [kpc] < 10.0.

We identified a large number of clusters, many\nof which could tentatively be merged into larger groups. Our goal is to\nestablish the reality of the clusters through a combined study of their stellar\npopulations to gain more insights into the accretion history of the Milky Way.\nWe develop a procedure that quantifies the similarity of clusters based on KS\ntests using their metallicity distribution functions, and an isochrone fitting\nmethod to determine their average age, which is also used to compare the\ndistribution of stars in the Colour-Absolute magnitude diagram. This allows us\nto group clusters into substructures, and to compare substructures with one\nanother. The clusters identified are merged into 12 extended substructures,\nwhile 8 small clusters remain as such. The large substructures include the\npreviously known Gaia-Enceladus, Helmi streams, Sequoia, and Thamnos 1 and 2.\nWe identify overdensities associated with the hot thick disc and hosting a\nmetal-poor population. Especially notable is our largest substructure which,\nalthough peaking at the metallicity characteristic of the thick disk has a well\npopulated metal-poor component, and dynamics in-between hot thick disc and\nhalo. We identify additional debris in the region occupied by Sequoia with\ndistinct kinematics, likely remnants of three different accretion events with\nprogenitors of similar mass. We also identify different trends of [Mg/Fe] vs\n[Fe/H] for the various substructures confirming our dissection of the nearby\nhalo. At least 20\% of the halo near the Sun is associated to substructures.\nWhen comparing their global properties, we note that those substructures on\nretrograde orbits are not only more metal-poor on average but also older.</td>

We detect sources as faint as F148W $\sim$ 23.5~mag\nwhich are classified based on their locations in CMDs by overlaying stellar\nevolutionary models. The CMDs of 8 GCs are combined with the previous UVIT\nstudies of 3 GCs to create stacked FUV-optical CMDs to highlight the\nfeatures/peculiarities found in the different evolutionary sequences. The FUV\n(F148W) detected stellar populations of 11 GCs comprises 2,816 Horizontal\nBranch (HB) stars (190 Extreme HB candidates), 46 post-HB (pHB), 221 Blue\nStraggler Stars (BSS), and 107 White Dwarf (WD) candidates. We note that the\nblue HB color extension obtained from F148W$-$G color and the number of FUV\ndetected EHB candidates are strongly correlated with the maximum internal\nHelium (He) variation within each GC, suggesting that the FUV-optical plane is\nthe most sensitive to He abundance variations in the HB.

      <td>A direct measurement of the distance to the Galactic center using the kinematics of bar stars</td>
      <td>The distance to the Galactic center $R_0$ is a fundamental parameter for\nunderstanding the Milky Way, because all observations of our Galaxy are made\nfrom our heliocentric reference point. The uncertainty in $R_0$ limits our\nknowledge of many aspects of the Milky Way, including its total mass and the\nrelative mass of its major components, and any orbital parameters of stars\nemployed in chemo-dynamical analyses. While measurements of $R_0$ have been\nimproving over a century, measurements in the past few years from a variety of\nmethods still find a wide range of $R_0$ being somewhere within $8.0$ to\n$8.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$. The most precise measurements to date have to assume that\nSgr A$^*$ is at rest at the Galactic center, which may not be the case. In this\npaper, we use maps of the kinematics of stars in the Galactic bar derived from\nAPOGEE DR17 and Gaia EDR3 data augmented with spectro-photometric distances\nfrom the \texttt{astroNN} neural-network method. These maps clearly display the\nminimum in the rotational velocity $v_T$ and the quadrupolar signature in\nradial velocity $v_R$ expected for stars orbiting in a bar. From the minimum in\n$v_T$, we measure $R_0 = 8.23 \pm 0.12\,\mathrm{kpc}$. We validate our\nmeasurement using realistic $N$-body simulations of the Milky Way. We further\nmeasure the pattern speed of the bar to be $\Omega_\mathrm{bar} =\n40.08\pm1.78\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}$. Because the bar forms out\nof the disk, its center is manifestly the barycenter of the bar+disc system and\nour measurement is therefore the most robust and accurate measurement of $R_0$\nto date.</td>

They exhibit significant enrichment in\ntheir nitrogen abundance ratios ([N/Fe] $\gtrsim+0.5$), along with simultaneous\ndepletions in their [C/Fe] abundance ratios ([C/Fe] $< +0.15$), and they cover\na wide range of metallicities ($-1.8 < $ [Fe/H] $ <-0.7$). The final sample of\ncandidate N-rich red giant stars with globular-cluster-like (GC-like) abundance\npatterns from the APOGEE survey includes a grand total of $\sim$ 412 unique\nobjects. These strongly N-enhanced stars are speculated to have been stripped\nfrom GCs based on their chemical similarities with these systems.

      <td>Using numerical simulations, we have studied the escape of globular clusters\n(GCs) from the satellite dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) of the Milky Way\n(MW). We start by following the orbits of a large sample of GCs around dSphs in\nthe presence of the MW potential field. We then obtain the fraction of GCs\nleaving their host dSphs within a Hubble Time. We model dSphs by a Hernquist\ndensity profile with masses between $10^7\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and $7\times\n10^9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. All dSphs lie on the Galactic disc plane, but they\nhave different orbital eccentricities and apogalactic distances. We compute the\nescape fraction of GCs from 13 of the most massive dSphs of the MW, using their\nrealistic orbits around the MW (as determined by Gaia). The escape fraction of\nGCs from 13 dSphs is in the range $12\%$ to $93\%$. The average escape time of\nGCs from these dSphs was less than 8 $\,\mathrm{Gyrs}$, indicating that the\nescape process of GCs from dSphs was over. We then adopt a set of\nobservationally-constrained density profiles for specific case of the Fornax\ndSph. According to our results, the escape fraction of GCs shows a negative\ncorrelation with both the mass and the apogalactic distance of the dSphs, as\nwell as a positive correlation with the orbital eccentricity of dSphs. In\nparticular, we find that the escape fraction of GCs from the Fornax dSph is\nbetween $13\%$ and $38\%$. Finally, we observe that when GCs leave their host\ndSphs, their final orbit around the MW does not differ much from their host\ndSphs.</td>

After applying this routine\nto the catalogue of 91234 variables, we are able to report sixteen unique RR\nLyrae substructures with physical sizes of less than 1 kpc. Five of these\nsubstructures are in close proximity to Milky Way globular clusters with\npreviously known tidal tails and/or a potential connection to Galactic merger\nevents. One candidate substructure is in the neighbourhood of the Large\nMagellanic Cloud but is more distant (and older) than known satellites of the\ndwarf galaxy.

      <td>We have applied our method for weighing the Galactic disk using phase-space\nspirals to the Gaia EDR3 proper motion sample. For stars in distant regions of\nthe Galactic disk, the latitudinal proper motion has a close projection with\nvertical velocity, such that the phase-space spiral in the plane of vertical\nposition and vertical velocity can be observed without requiring that all stars\nhave available radial velocity information. We divided the Galactic plane into\n360 separate data samples, each corresponding to an area cell in the Galactic\nplane in the distance range of 1.4-3.4 kpc, with an approximate cell length of\n200-400 pc. Roughly half of our data samples were disqualified altogether due\nto severe selection effects, especially in the direction of the Galactic\ncentre. In the remainder, we were able to infer the vertical gravitational\npotential by fitting an analytic model of the phase-space spiral to the data.\nThis work is the first of its kind, in the sense that we are weighing distant\nregions of the Galactic disk with a high spatial resolution, without relying on\nthe strong assumptions of axisymmetry. Post-inference, we fit a thin disk scale\nlength of $2.2\pm 0.1$ kpc, although this value is sensitive to the considered\nspatial region. We see surface density variations as a function of azimuth on\nthe order of 10-20 %, which is roughly the size of our estimated sum of\npotential systematic biases. With this work, we have demonstrated that our\nmethod can be used to weigh distant regions of the Galactic disk despite strong\nselection effects. We expect to reach even greater distances and improve our\naccuracy with future Gaia data releases and further improvements to our method.</td>

      <td>Structural parameters and possible association of the Ultra-Faint Dwarfs Pegasus III and Pisces II from deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry</td>
      <td>We present deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of the ultra-faint\ndwarf (UFD) galaxies Pegasus III (Peg III) and Pisces II (Psc II), two of the\nmost distant satellites in the halo of the Milky Way (MW). We measure the\nstructure of both galaxies, derive mass-to-light ratios with newly determined\nabsolute magnitudes, and compare our findings to expectations from UFD-mass\nsimulations. For Peg III, we find an elliptical half-light radius of\n$a_h{{=}}1.88^{+0.42}_{-0.33}$ arcminutes ($118^{+31}_{-30}$ pc) and\n$M_V{=}{-4.17}^{+0.19}_{-0.22}$; for Psc II, we measure\n$a_h{=}1.31^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ arcminutes ($69\pm8$ pc) and\n$M_V{=}{-4.28}^{+0.19}_{-0.16}$. We do not find any morphological features that\nindicate a significant interaction between the two has occurred, despite their\nclose separation of only $\sim$40 kpc. Using proper motions (PMs) from Gaia\nearly Data Release 3, we investigate the possibility of any past association by\nintegrating orbits for the two UFDs in a MW-only and a combined MW and Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) potential. We find that including the gravitational\ninfluence of the LMC is crucial, even for these outer-halo satellites, and that\na possible orbital history exists where Peg III and Psc II experienced a close\n($\sim$10-20 kpc) passage about each other just over $\sim$1 Gyr ago, followed\nby a collective passage around the LMC ($\sim$30-60 kpc) just under $\sim$1 Gyr\nago. Considering the large uncertainties on the PMs and the restrictive priors\nimposed to derive them, improved PM measurements for Peg III and Psc II will be\nnecessary to clarify their relationship. This would add to the rare findings of\nconfirmed pairs of satellites within the Local Group.</td>

      <td>An ensemble of chemical abundances probing different nucleosynthetic channels\ncan be leveraged to build a comprehensive understanding of the chemical and\nstructural evolution of the Galaxy. Using GALAH DR3 data, we seek to trace the\nenrichment by the supernovae Ia, supernovae II, asymptotic giant branch stars,\nand neutron-star mergers and/or collapsars nucleosynthetic sources by studying\nthe [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe], [Ba/Fe], and [Eu/Fe] chemical compositions of\n$\sim$50,000 red giant stars, respectively. Employing small\n[Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe] cells, which serve as an effective reference-frame of\nsupernovae contributions, we characterise the abundance-age profiles for\n[Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe]. Our results disclose that these age-abundance relations\nvary across the [Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe] plane. Within cells, we find negative\nage-[Ba/Fe] relations and flat age-[Eu/Fe] relations. Across cells, we see the\nslope of the age-[Ba/Fe] relations evolve smoothly and the [Eu/Fe] relations\nvary in amplitude. We subsequently model our empirical findings in a\ntheoretical setting using the flexible Chempy Galactic chemical evolution (GCE)\ncode, using the mean [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Ba/Fe], and age values for stellar\npopulations binned in [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and age space. We find that within a\none-zone framework, an ensemble of GCE model parameters vary to explain the\ndata. Using present day orbits from \textit{Gaia} EDR3 measurements we infer\nthat the GCE model parameters, which set the observed chemical abundance\ndistributions, vary systematically across mean orbital radii. Under our\nmodelling assumptions, the observed chemical abundances are consistent with a\nsmall gradient in the high mass end of the initial mass function (IMF) across\nthe disc, where the IMF is more top heavy towards the inner disc and more\nbottom heavy in the outer disc.</td>

      <td>We identify substructures of the Galactic halo using 3,003 type $ab$ RR\nLyraes (RRab) with 6D position-velocity information from the SDSS, LAMOST, and\nGaia EDR3. Based on the information, we define the separation of any two of the\nstars in the integrals of motion space and identify substructures by utilizing\nthe friends-of-friends algorithm. We identify members belonging to several\nknown substructures: the Sagittarius stream, the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES),\nthe Sequoia, and the Helmi streams. In addition to these known substructures,\nthere are three other substructures possibly associated with globular clusters\nNGC 5272, NGC 6656, and NGC 5024, respectively. Finally, we also find three\nremaining unknown substructures and one of them has large angular momentum and\na mean metallicity $\rm -2.13\,dex$ which may be a new substructure. As for\nGES, we find that it accounts for a large part of substructures in the inner\nhalo and the range of apocenter distance is from 10 to $34\,\rm kpc$, which\nsuggests that the GES is mainly distributed in the inner halo. The near\none-third proportion of the GES and the peak value $20\,\rm kpc$ of the\napocenter distances suggest that GES could account for the break in the density\nprofile of the Galactic halo at Galactocentric distance ${\sim}20-25\,\rm kpc$.\nThe similarity of comparing the kinematic properties of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage\nwith the Hercules-Aquila Cloud and Virgo Overdensity suggests that the three\nsubstructures may have similar origins.</td>

      <td>APOGEE and GALAH are two high resolution multi-object spectroscopic surveys\nthat provide fundamental stellar parameters and multiple elemental abundance\nestimates for about half a million stars in the Milky Way. Both surveys observe\nin different wavelength regimes and use different data reduction pipelines\nleading to significant offsets and trends in stellar parameters and abundances\nfor the common stars observed in both surveys. Such systematic\ndifferences/offsets in stellar parameters and abundances make it difficult to\neffectively utilise them to investigate Galactic abundance trends in spite of\nthe unique advantage provided by their complementary sky coverage and different\nMilky Way components they observe. Hence, we use the \textit{Cannon}\ndata-driven method selecting a training set of 4418 common stars observed by\nboth surveys. This enables the construction of two catalogues, one with the\nAPOGEE scaled and the other with the GALAH scaled stellar parameters. Using\nrepeat observations in APOGEE and GALAH, we find high precision in metallicity\n(~ 0.02-0.4 dex) and alpha abundances (~ 0.02-0.03 dex) for spectra with good\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR > 80 for APOGEE, SNR > 40 for GALAH). We use open\nand globular clusters to validate our parameter estimates and find small\nscatter in metallicity (0.06 dex) and alpha abundances (0.03 dex) in APOGEE\nscaled case. The final catalogues have been cross matched with the Gaia EDR3\ncatalogue to enable their use to carry out detailed chemo-dynamic studies of\nthe Milky Way from perspectives of APOGEE and GALAH.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Chemical tagging in the thin disk. Open clusters blindly recovered in the elemental abundance space</td>
      <td>The chemical makeup of a star provides the fossil information of the\nenvironment where it formed. Under this premise, it should be possible to use\nchemical abundances to tag stars that formed within the same stellar\nassociation. This idea - known as chemical tagging - has not produced the\nexpected results, especially within the thin disk where open stellar clusters\nhave chemical patterns that are difficult to disentangle. The ultimate goal of\nthis study is to probe the feasibility of chemical tagging within the thin disk\npopulation using high-quality data from a controlled sample of stars. We also\naim at improving the existing techniques of chemical tagging and giving\nguidance on different strategies of clustering analysis in the elemental\nabundance space. Here we develop the first blind search of open clusters'\nmembers through clustering analysis in the elemental abundance space using the\nOPTICS algorithm applied to data from the Gaia-ESO survey. First, we evaluate\ndifferent strategies of analysis, determining which ones are more performing.\nSecond, we apply these methods to a data set including both field stars and\nopen clusters attempting a blind recover of as many open clusters as possible.\nWe show how specific strategies of data analysis can improve the final results.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that open clusters can be more efficaciously\nrecovered with the Manhattan metric and on a space whose dimensions are\ncarefully selected. Using these (and other) prescriptions we are able to\nrecover open clusters hidden in our data set and find new members of these\nstellar associations. Our results indicate that there are chances of recovering\nopen clusters' members via clustering analysis in the elemental abundance\nspace. Presumably, the performances of chemical tagging will further increase\nwith higher quality data and more sophisticated clustering algorithms.</td>

The concordant trends in phase-space between the model\nand observations imply that the stream might have been perturbed by LMC. The\ntwo most distant stars among 11 detected members trace the stream's length to\n$60^\circ$ of sky, supporting and extending the previous length of $45^\circ$.\nGiven that NGC 5466 is so distant and potentially has a longer tail than\npreviously thought, we expect that NGC 5466 tidal stream could be a useful tool\nin constraining the Milky Way gravitational field.</td>

      <td>High-precision chemical abundances of Galactic building blocks. II. Revisiting the chemical distinctness of the Helmi streams</td>
      <td>Context: The Helmi streams are kinematic substructures whose progenitor is\nlikely a dwarf galaxy. Although 20 years have past since their discovery, it is\nstill unclear whether their members are chemically distinguishable from other\nhalo stars in the Milky Way. Aim: We aim to precisely characterize the chemical\nproperties of the Helmi streams. Methods: We analysed high-resolution,\nhigh-signal-to-noise ratio spectra for eleven Helmi streams' stars through a\nline-by-line abundance analysis. We compared the derived abundances to\nhomogenized literature abundances of the other halo stars, including those\nbelonging to other kinematic substructures, such as Gaia-Enceladus and Sequoia.\nResults: Compared to typical halo stars, the Helmi streams' members clearly\nshow low values of [X/Fe] in elements produced by massive stars, such as Na and\n$\alpha$-elements. This tendency is seen down to metallicities of at least\n$[\mathrm{Fe/H}]\sim -2.2$, suggesting type~Ia supernovae already started to\ncontribute to the chemical evolution at this metallicity. We found that the\n[$\alpha$/Fe] ratio does not evolve much with metallicity, making the Helmi\nstreams' stars less distinguishable from Gaia-Enceladus stars at\n$[\mathrm{Fe/H}]\gtrsim -1.5$. The almost constant but low value of\n[$\alpha$/Fe] might be indicative of quiescent star formation with low\nefficiency at the beginning and bursty star formation at later times. We also\nfound extremely low values of [Y/Fe] at low metallicity, providing further\nsupport that light neutron capture-elements are deficient in Helmi streams.\nWhile Zn is deficient at low metallicity, it shows a large spread at high\nmetallicity. The origin of the extremely low Y abundances and Zn variations\nremain unclear. Conclusion: The Helmi streams' stars are distinguishable from\nthe majority of the halo stars if homogeneously derived abundances are\ncompared.</td>

Apart\nfrom Whiting 1 and NGC 7492, which are projected against the Sagittarius\nstream, we see no evidence for adjacent stellar populations to indicate any of\nthese clusters is associated with coherent tidal debris from a destroyed host\ndwarf. We also find no evidence for tidal tails around any of the clusters in\nour sample; however, both NGC 1904 and 6981 appear to possess outer envelopes.\nMotivated by a slew of recent Gaia-based discoveries, we compile a sample of\nclusters with robust detections of extra-tidal structure, and search for\ncorrelations with orbital properties. While we observe that clusters with tidal\ntails are typically on moderately or very eccentric orbits that are highly\ninclined to the Galactic plane and often retrograde, these are neither\nnecessary nor sufficient conditions for the formation of extra-tidal structure.\nThat many objects with tidal tails appear to be accreted leads us to speculate\nthat this lack of consistency may stem from the inhomogeneous dynamical history\nof the Milky Way globular cluster system. Finally, we note that clusters with\nprominent stellar envelopes detected in ground-based imaging (such as NGC 1851\nand 7089) are now all known from Gaia to possess long tidal tails --\nexperimental confirmation that the presence of an extended envelope is\nindicative of tidal erosion.</td>

The maps\nare rich in substructures and reveal the perturbed state of the Galactic disc.\nWe find that local differences between rotational velocity and the azimuthally\naveraged velocity, $\Delta V$, display at least five large-scale kinematic\nspirals; two of them closely follow the locus of the Sagittarius-Carina and\nPerseus spiral arms, with pitch angles of 9.12$^{\circ}$ and 7.76$^{\circ}$,\nand vertical thickness of $\sim400$ pc and $\sim600$ pc, respectively. Another\nkinematic spiral is located behind the Perseus arm and appears as a distortion\nin rotation velocities left by this massive arm but with no known counterpart\nin gas/stars overdensity. A weaker signal close to the Sun's position is\npresent in our three velocity maps, and appears to be associated with the Local\narm. Our analysis of the stellar velocities in the Galactic disc shows\nkinematic differences between arms and inter-arms, that are in favour of Milky\nWay spiral arms that do not corotate with the disc. Moreover, we show that the\nkinematic spirals are clumpy and flocculent, revealing the underlying nature of\nthe Milky Way spiral arms.</td>

At the faint end, we\ncomputed proper motions of 11,519 point-like objects at i-band magnitudes\n19--25 AB using Hubble ACS and Subaru HSC, which span two epochs about 11 years\napart. In order to measure these proper motions with unprecedented accuracy at\nfaint magnitudes, we developed a foundational set of astrometric tools which\nwill be required for Joint Survey Processing (JSP) of data from the next\ngeneration of optical/infrared surveys. The astrometric grids of Hubble ACS and\nSubaru HSC mosaics were corrected at the catalog level, using proper\nmotion-propagated and parallax-corrected Gaia DR2 sources. These astrometric\ncorrections were verified using compact extragalactic sources. Upon comparison\nof our measured proper motions with Gaia DR2, we estimate the uncertainties in\nour measurements to be ~2--3 mas/yr per axis, down to 25.5 AB mag. We corrected\nproper motions for the mean motion of the Sun, and we find that late-type\nmain-sequence stars predominantly in the thin disk in the COSMOS field have\nspace velocities mainly towards the Galactic center.

The sources\nfrom the faint star sample may be candidate halo members of the Sangarius\nstream.</td>

      <td>The Extended Tidal Tails of NGC 7089 (M2)</td>
      <td>Using photometry and proper motions from Gaia Early Data Release 3, we detect\na 45 degree-long trailing stellar debris stream associated with the old,\nmetal-poor globular cluster NGC 7089. With a width on the order of 100 pc, the\nextended stream appears to be as dynamically cold as the coldest known streams\nfound to date. There is some evidence for an extended leading tail extending\nbetween 28 and 37 degrees from the cluster, though the greater distance of this\ntail, combined with proper motions that are virtually indistinguishable from\nthose of foreground stars, make the detection much less certain. The proper\nmotion profile and the path on the sky of the trailing tail are not well\nmatched using a simple Galactic potential comprised purely of a disk, bulge,\nand spherical halo. However, the addition of a moving, massive (M = 1.88 x\n10^(11) solar masses) Large Magellanic Cloud brings the model predictions into\nmuch better agreement with the observables. We provide tables of the most\nhighly ranked candidate stream stars for follow-up by ongoing and future\nspectroscopic surveys.</td>

      <td>Wide binaries from the H3 survey: the thick disk and halo have similar wide binary fractions</td>
      <td>Due to the different environments in the Milky Way's disk and halo, comparing\nwide binaries in the disk and halo is key to understanding wide binary\nformation and evolution. By using Gaia Early Data Release 3, we search for\nresolved wide binary companions in the H3 survey, a spectroscopic survey that\nhas compiled $\sim$150,000 spectra for thick-disk and halo stars to date. We\nidentify 800 high-confidence (a contamination rate of 4%) wide binaries and two\nresolved triples, with binary separations mostly between $10^3$-$10^5$ AU and a\nlowest [Fe/H] of $-2.7$. Based on their Galactic kinematics, 33 of them are\nhalo wide binaries, and most of those are associated with the accreted\nGaia-Sausage-Enceladus galaxy. The wide binary fraction in the thick disk\ndecreases toward the low metallicity end, consistent with the previous findings\nfor the thin disk. Our key finding is that the halo wide binary fraction is\nconsistent with the thick-disk stars at a fixed [Fe/H]. There is no significant\ndependence of the wide binary fraction on the $\alpha$-captured abundance.\nTherefore, the wide binary fraction is mainly determined by the iron abundance,\nnot their disk or halo origin nor the $\alpha$-captured abundance. Our results\nsuggest that the formation environments play a major role for the wide binary\nfraction, instead of other processes like radial migration that only apply to\ndisk stars.</td>

      <td>Bending waves excited by irregular gas inflow along warps</td>
      <td>Gaia has revealed clear evidence of bending waves in the vertical kinematics\nof stars in the Solar Neighbourhood. We study bending waves in two simulations,\none warped, with the warp due to misaligned gas inflow, and the other unwarped.\nWe find slow, retrograde bending waves in both models, with the ones in the\nwarped model having larger amplitudes. We also find fast, prograde bending\nwaves. Prograde bending waves in the unwarped model are very weak, in agreement\nwith the expectation that these waves should decay on short, ~ crossing,\ntimescales, due to strong winding. However, prograde bending waves are much\nstronger for the duration of the warped model, pointing to irregular gas inflow\nalong the warp as a continuous source of excitation. We demonstrate that large\namplitude bending waves that propagate through the Solar Neighbourhood give\nrise to a correlation between the mean vertical velocity and the angular\nmomentum, with a slope consistent with that found by Gaia. The bending waves\naffect populations of all ages, but the sharpest features are found in the\nyoung populations, hinting that short wavelength waves are not supported by the\nolder, kinematically hotter, populations. Our results demonstrate the\nimportance of misaligned gas accretion as a recurrent source of vertical\nperturbations of disc galaxies, including in the Milky Way.</td>

      <td>Three-dimensional (3D) maps of Galactic interstellar dust are a tool for a\nwide range of uses. We aim to construct 3D maps of dust extinction in the Local\nArm and surrounding regions. Gaia EDR3 photometric data were combined with\n2MASS measurements to derive extinction towards stars with accurate photometry\nand relative uncertainties on parallaxes of less than 20%. We applied our\nhierarchical inversion algorithm adapted to inhomogeneous spatial distributions\nof target stars to this catalogue of extinctions. We present the updated 3D\ndust extinction distribution and provide an estimate of the error on integrated\nextinctions from the Sun to each area in the 3D map. The computational area is\nsimilar to the one of the previous DR2 map, a 6 kpc x 6 kpc x 0.8\nkpcAstrophysics volume around the Sun. Due to the addition of fainter target\nstars, the volume in which the clouds can be reconstructed has increased. Due\nto the improved accuracy of the parallaxes and photometric data in EDR3,\nextinctions among neighbouring targets are more consistent, allowing one to\nreach an increased contrast in the dense areas, while cavity contours are more\nregular. We show several comparisons with recent results on dust and star\ndistributions. The wavy pattern around the Plane of the dust concentrations is\nbetter seen and exists over large regions. Its mean vertical peak-to-peak\namplitude is of the order of 300 pc; interestingly, it is similar to the\nvertical period of the spectacular snail-shaped stellar kinematical pattern\ndiscovered in Gaia data. The Gaia EDR3 catalogue allows for a significant\nimprovement of the extinction maps to be made and the hierarchical technique\nconfirms its efficiency for massive datasets. Future comparisons between 3D\nmaps of interstellar matter and stellar distributions may help to understand\nwhich mergers or internal perturbations have shaped the Galaxy within the first\n3 kpc.</td>

Our aim is to keep completing the open cluster census in the Milky\nWay with the detection of new stellar groups in the Galactic disc. We use\n\textit{Gaia} EDR3 up to magnitude $G = 18$ mag, increasing in one unit the\nmagnitude limit and therefore the search volume explored in our previous\nstudies. We use the \texttt{OCfinder} method to search for new open clusters in\n\textit{Gaia} EDR3 using a Big Data environment. As a first step,\n\texttt{OCfinder} identifies stellar statistical overdensities in the five\ndimensional astrometric space (position, parallax and proper motions) using the\n\texttt{DBSCAN} clustering algorithm. Then, these overdensities are classified\ninto random statistical overdensities or real physical open clusters using a\ndeep artificial neural network trained on well-characterised $G$, $G_{\rm BP} -\nG_{\rm RP}$ colour-magnitude diagrams. We report the discovery of $664$ new\nopen clusters within the Galactic disc, most of them located beyond $1$ kpc\nfrom the Sun. From the estimation of ages, distances and line-of-sight\nextinctions of these open clusters, we see that young clusters align following\nthe Galactic spiral arms while older ones are dispersed in the Galactic disc.\nFurthermore, we find that most open clusters are located at low Galactic\naltitudes with the exception of a few groups older than $1$ Gyr.

The Gaussian\nMixture Model is employed to distinguish the high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$\nsequences along the metallicity by simutaneously using the chemical and\nkinematical data. Four disk components are identified and quantified that named\nas h$\alpha$mp, h$\alpha$mr, l$\alpha$mp, and l$\alpha$mr disks, which\ncorrespond to the features of high-$\alpha$ or low-$\alpha$, and metal-poor or\nmetal-rich. Combined with the spatial and stellar age information, we confirm\nthat they are well interpreted in the two-infall formation model. The first\ninfall of turbulent gas quickly forms the hot and thick h$\alpha$mp disk with\nconsequent thinner h$\alpha$mr and l$\alpha$mr disks. Then the second gas\naccretion forms a thinner and outermost l$\alpha$mp disk. We find that the\ninside-out and upside-down scenario does not only satisfy the overall Galactic\ndisk formation of these two major episodes, but also presents in the formation\nsequence of three inner disks. Importantly, we reveal the inverse Age-[M/H]\ntrend of the l$\alpha$mr disk, which means its younger stars are more\nmetal-poor, indicating that the rejuvenate gas from the second accretion\ngradually dominates the later star formation. Meanwhile, the recently formed\nstars convergence to [M/H]$\sim$-0.1 dex, demonstrating a sufficiently mixture\nof gas from two infalls.</td>

The $Gaia$ Early Data Release 3 ($Gaia$ EDR3) has now allowed for a\nbreakthrough in this research landscape. In this study, we focus on a sample of\nsingle Galactic post-AGBs for which chemical abundance studies were completed.\nWe combined photometry with geometric distances to carry out a spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) analysis and derive accurate luminosities. We subsequently\ndetermined their positions on the HR-diagram and compared this with theoretical\npost-AGB evolutionary tracks. While most objects are in the post-AGB phase of\nevolution, we found a subset of low-luminosity objects that are likely to be in\nthe post-horizontal branch phase of evolution, similar to AGB-manqu\'e objects\nfound in globular clusters. Additionally, we also investigated the observed\nbi-modality in the $s$-process enrichment of Galactic post-AGB single stars of\nsimilar Teff, and metallicities. This bi-modality was expected to be a direct\nconsequence of luminosity with the $s$-process rich objects having evolved\nfurther on the AGB. However, we find that the two populations: the $s$-process\nenriched and non-enriched, have similar luminosities (and hence initial\nmasses), revealing an intriguing chemical diversity. For a given initial mass\nand metallicity, AGB nucleosynthesis appears inhomogeneous and sensitive to\nother factors which could be mass-loss, along with convective and\nnon-convective mixing mechanisms. Modelling individual objects in detail will\nbe needed to investigate which parameters and processes dominate the\nphotospheric chemical enrichment in these stars.</td>

      <td>Measuring the Milky Way mass distribution in the presence of the LMC</td>

We present a method for compensating these perturbations for any\nchoice of MW potential by computing the past trajectory of LMC and MW and then\nintegrating the orbits of tracer objects back in time until the influence of\nthe LMC is negligible, at which point the equilibrium approximation can be used\nwith any standard dynamical modelling approach. We add this orbit-rewinding\nstep to the mass estimation approach based on simultaneous fitting of the\npotential and the distribution function of tracers, and apply it to two\ndatasets with the latest Gaia EDR3 measurements of 6d phase-space coordinates:\nglobular clusters and satellite galaxies. We find that models with LMC mass in\nthe range (1-2)x10^11 Msun better fit the observed distribution of tracers, and\nmeasure MW mass within 100 kpc to be (0.75+-0.1)x10^12 Msun, while neglecting\nthe LMC perturbation increases it by ~15%.</td>

We use high resolution optical spectra for\n62 GES stars to measure abundances in 20 elements spanning the $\alpha$,\nFe-peak, light, odd-Z, and notably, the neutron-capture groups of elements to\nunderstand their trends in the context of and in contrast to the Milky Way and\nother stellar populations. Using these derived abundances we find that the\noptical and the infrared abundances agree to within 0.15 dex except for O, Co,\nNa, Cu, and Ce. These stars have enhanced neutron-capture abundance trends\ncompared to the Milky Way, and their [Eu/Mg] and neutron-capture abundance\nratios (e.g., [Y/Eu], [Ba/Eu], [Zr/Ba], [La/Ba], and [Nd/Ba]) point to\nr-process enhancement and a delay in s-process enrichment. Their [$\alpha$/Fe]\ntrend is lower than the Milky Way trend for [Fe/H]$>$-1.5 dex, similar to\nprevious studies of GES stars and consistent with the picture that these stars\nformed in a system with a lower rate of star formation. This is further\nsupported by their depleted abundances in Ni, Na, and Cu abundances, again,\nsimilar to previous studies of low-$\alpha$ stars with accreted origins.</td>

The\ngenerating mechanism of these breathing motions is thought to be spiral density\nwaves. Here we test this hypothesis. Using a self-consistent, high-resolution\nsimulation with star formation, and which hosts prominent spirals, we first\nstudy the signatures of breathing motions excited by spirals. In the model, the\nbreathing motions induced by the spiral structure have an increasing amplitude\nwith distance from the mid-plane, pointing to an internal cause for them. We\nthen show that, at fixed height, the breathing motion amplitude decreases with\nage. Next, we investigate the signature of the breathing motions in the Gaia\nDR2 dataset. We demonstrate that, at the location with a consistently large\nbreathing motion, the corresponding amplitude increases monotonically with\ndistance from the mid-plane, in agreement with the model. Furthermore, we show\nthat at the same location, the breathing motion amplitude decreases with age,\nagain similar to what we find in the model. This strengthens the case that the\nobserved breathing motions are driven by spiral density waves.</td>

In the velocity distribution for three\nmagnitude-binned subsamples we however find a novel structure at $(U, V) = (7,\n-19)$ km s$^{-1}$ in fainter samples, potentially related to the Coma Berenices\nstream. We also see a double-peaked feature in $U$-$W$ at $U \approx -30$ km\ns$^{-1}$ and in $V$-$W$ at $V \approx -20$ km s$^{-1}$ for fainter samples. We\ndetermine the velocity distribution and velocity moments as a function of\nabsolute magnitude for two samples based on the bifurcation identified in Gaia\nData Release 2 in the colour-magnitude diagram. The brighter, redder sequence\nhas a larger velocity dispersion than the fainter, bluer sequence across all\nmagnitudes. It is hard to reconcile this kinematic difference with a\nbifurcation caused purely by atmospheric composition, while it fits neatly with\na significant age difference between the two sequences. Our results provide\nnovel insights into the kinematic properties of white dwarfs and demonstrate\nthe power of analytical techniques that work for the large fraction of stars\nthat do not have measured radial velocities in the current era of large-scale\nastrometric surveys.</td>

      <td>A Tilt in the Dark Matter Halo of the Galaxy</td>
      <td>Recent observations of the stellar halo have uncovered the debris of an\nancient merger, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, estimated to have occurred ~8 Gyr ago.\nFollow-up studies have associated GSE with a large-scale tilt in the stellar\nhalo that links two well-known stellar over-densities in diagonally opposing\noctants of the Galaxy (the Hercules-Aquila Cloud and Virgo Overdensity; HAC and\nVOD). In this paper, we study the plausibility of such unmixed merger debris\npersisting over several Gyr in the Galactic halo. We employ the simulated\nstellar halo from Naidu et al. (2021), which reproduces several key properties\nof the merger remnant, including the large-scale tilt. By integrating the\norbits of these simulated stellar halo particles, we show that adoption of a\nspherical halo potential results in rapid phase mixing of the asymmetry.\nHowever, adopting a tilted halo potential preserves the initial asymmetry in\nthe stellar halo for many Gyr. The asymmetry is preserved even when a realistic\ngrowing disk is added to the potential. These results suggest that HAC and VOD\nare long-lived structures that are associated with GSE and that the dark matter\nhalo of the Galaxy is tilted with respect to the disk and aligned in the\ndirection of HAC-VOD. Such halo-disk misalignment is common in modern\ncosmological simulations. Lastly, we study the relationship between the local\nand global stellar halo in light of a tilted global halo comprised of highly\nradial orbits. We find that the local halo offers a dynamically biased view of\nthe global halo due to its displacement from the Galactic Center.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Age-chemical-clock relations spatially resolved in the Galactic disc</td>
      <td>The last decade has seen a revolution in our knowledge of the Galaxy thanks\nto the Gaia and asteroseismic space missions and the ground-based spectroscopic\nsurveys. To complete this picture, it is necessary to map the ages of its\nstellar populations. During recent years, the dependence on time of abundance\nratios involving slow (s) neutron-capture and $\alpha$ elements (called\nchemical-clocks) has been used to provide estimates of stellar ages, usually in\na limited volume close to the Sun. We aim to analyse the relations of chemical\nclocks in the Galactic disc extending the range to R$_{\rm GC}\sim$6-20~kpc.\nUsing the sixth internal data release of the Gaia-ESO survey, we calibrated\nseveral relations between stellar ages and abundance ratios [s/$\alpha$] using\na sample of open clusters, the largest one so far used with this aim. Thanks to\ntheir wide galactocentric coverage, we investigated the radial variations of\nthe shape of these relations, confirming their non-universality. We estimated\nour accuracy and precision in recovering the global ages of open clusters, and\nthe ages of their individual members. We applied the multi-variate relations\nwith the highest correlation coefficients to the field star population. We\nconfirm that there is no single age-chemical clock relationship valid for the\nwhole disc, but that there is a dependence on the galactocentric position,\nwhich is related to the radial variation of the star formation history combined\nwith the non-monotonic dependence on metallicity of the yields of the s-process\nelements from low- and intermediate-mass stars. Finally, the abundance ratios\n[Ba/$\alpha$] are more sensitive to age than those with [Y/$\alpha$] for young\ndisc stars, and their slopes vary less with galactocentric distance.</td>

      <td>Forward and Back: Kinematics of the Palomar 5 Tidal Tails</td>
      <td>The tidal tails of Palomar 5 (Pal 5) have been the focus of many\nspectroscopic studies in an attempt to identify individual stars lying along\nthe stream and characterise their kinematics. The well-studied trailing tail\nhas been explored out to a distance of 15^\text{o} from the cluster centre,\nwhile less than four degrees have been examined along the leading tail. In this\npaper, we present results of a spectroscopic study of two fields along the\nleading tail that we have observed with the AAOmega spectrograph on the\nAnglo-Australian telescope. One of these fields lies roughly 7^\text{o} along\nthe leading tail, beyond what has been previously been explored\nspectroscopically. Combining our measurements of kinematics and line strengths\nwith Pan-STARRS1 photometric data and Gaia EDR3 astrometry, we adopt a\nprobabilistic approach to identify 16 stars with high probability of belonging\nto the Pal 5 stream. Eight of these stars lie in the outermost field and their\nsky positions confirm the presence of ``fanning'' in the leading arm. We also\nrevisit previously-published radial velocity studies and incorporate Gaia EDR3\nastrometry to remove interloping field stars. With a final sample of 109 {\it\nbona fide} Pal 5 cluster and tidal stream stars, we characterise the 3D\nkinematics along the the full extent of the system. We provide this catalogue\nfor future modeling work.</td>

Observations span a time baseline of 2$-$5 yr.\nWe combine the VMC data with data from the Gaia early Data Release 3 and\nintroduce a new method to distinguish between Magellanic and Milky Way stars\nbased on a machine learning algorithm. This new technique enables a larger and\ncleaner sample selection of fainter sources as it reaches below the red clump\nof the LMC. We investigate the impact of the SMC on the rotational field of the\nLMC and find hints of stripped SMC debris. The south east region of the LMC\nshows a slow rotational speed compared to the overall rotation. $N$-body\nsimulations suggest that this could be caused by a fraction of stripped SMC\nstars, located in that particular region, that move opposite to the expected\nrotation.</td>

      <td>The structure of accreted stellar streams</td>
      <td>Many of the Milky Way's globular clusters are likely accreted from satellite\ngalaxies that have long since merged with the Milky Way. When these globular\nclusters are susceptible to tidal disruption, this process likely starts\nalready inside the parent satellite leading to an early stellar stream within\nthe satellite. When the parent satellite merges with the Milky Way, the\nglobular cluster and its pre-merger stellar stream are accreted in a somewhat\nchaotic process. Here, we investigate the properties of the accreted stream\nafter the merger as we would see it today using a suite of simulations of\naccretion events. We find that the accretion process leads to a wide range of\nbehaviors, but generally scatters the accreted stream over a wide,\ntwo-dimensional area of the sky. The behavior ranges from a set of a few or\nmore well-defined "sub-streams" extending out from the post-merger thin stream\nby tens of degrees, to more widely dispersed debris over much of the sky,\ndepending on how close to the center of the MilkyWay the merger happened. Using\nmock Gaia-like observations of the simulated streams, we demonstrate that an\naccreted-stream component can explain the off-track features observed in the\nGD-1 stream. Sub-streams can appear like thin tidal streams themselves that are\nseemingly unassociated with the post-merger stream, raising the possibility\nthat some of the progenitor-less streams observed in the Milky Way are part of\na single or a few accreted streams created in an ancient merger event.</td>

      <td>The GALAH Survey: Chemical tagging and chrono-chemodynamics of accreted halo stars with GALAH+ DR3 and $Gaia$ eDR3</td>
      <td>Since the advent of $Gaia$ astrometry, it is possible to identify massive\naccreted systems within the Galaxy through their unique dynamical signatures.\nOne such system, $Gaia$-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), appears to be an early\n"building block" given its virial mass $> 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ at infall\n($z\sim1-3$). In order to separate the progenitor population from the\nbackground stars, we investigate its chemical properties with up to 30 element\nabundances from the GALAH+ Survey Data Release 3 (DR3). To inform our choice of\nelements for purely chemically selecting accreted stars, we analyse 4164 stars\nwith low-$\alpha$ abundances and halo kinematics. These are most different to\nthe Milky Way stars for abundances of Mg, Si, Na, Al, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Cu. Based\non the significance of abundance differences and detection rates, we apply\nGaussian mixture models to various element abundance combinations. We find the\nmost populated and least contaminated component, which we confirm to represent\nGSE, contains 1049 stars selected via [Na/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] in GALAH+ DR3. We\nprovide tables of our selections and report the chrono-chemodynamical\nproperties (age, chemistry, and dynamics). Through a previously reported clean\ndynamical selection of GSE stars, including $30 <\n\sqrt{J_R~/~\mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}} < 55$, we can characterise an\nunprecedented 24 abundances of this structure with GALAH+ DR3. Our chemical\nselection allows us to prevent circular reasoning and characterise the\ndynamical properties of the GSE, for example mean\n$\sqrt{J_R~/~\mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}} = 26_{-14}^{+9}$. We find only\n$(29\pm1)\%$ of the GSE stars within the clean dynamical selection region. Our\nmethodology will improve future studies of accreted structures and their\nimportance for the formation of the Milky Way.</td>

      <td>Estimating the local dark matter density in a non-axisymmetric wobbling disc</td>
      <td>The density of dark matter near the Sun is important for experiments hunting\nfor dark matter particles in the laboratory, and for constraining the local\nshape of the Milky Way's dark matter halo. Estimates to date have typically\nassumed that the Milky Way's stellar disc is axisymmetric and in a\nsteady-state. Yet the Milky Way disc is neither, exhibiting prominent spiral\narms and a bar, and vertical and radial oscillations. We assess the impact of\nthese assumptions on determinations of the local dark matter density by\napplying a free-form, steady-state, Jeans method to two different N-body\nsimulations of Milky Way-like galaxies. In one, the galaxy has experienced an\nancient major merger, similar to the hypothesized Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus; in\nthe other, the galaxy is perturbed more recently by the repeated passage and\nslow merger of a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy. We assess the impact of each of\nthe terms in the Jeans-Poisson equations on our ability to correctly extract\nthe local dark matter density from the simulated data. We find that common\napproximations employed in the literature - axisymmetry and a locally flat\nrotation curve - can lead to significant systematic errors of up to a factor\n~1.5 in the recovered surface mass density ~2kpc above the disc plane, implying\na fractional error on the local dark matter density of order unity. However,\nonce we add in the tilt term and the rotation curve term in our models, we\nobtain an unbiased estimate, consistent with the true value within our 95%\nconfidence intervals for realistic 20% uncertainties on the baryonic surface\ndensity of the disc. Other terms - the axial tilt, 2:nd Poisson and time\ndependent terms - contribute less than 10% to the local dark matter density\n(given current data) and can be safely neglected for now. In the future, as\nmore data become available, these terms will need to be included in the\nanalysis.</td>

The forthcoming Data\nRelease 3 (DR3) of the Gaia mission will allow us to study, with unprecedented\ndetail, the structure, the dynamics, and the chemical properties of the\nGalactic disc, and in particular of the spiral arms, where most Galactic DCEPs\nreside. In this paper, we aim to quantify the metallicity dependence of the\nGalactic DCEPs' period-Wesenheit ($PWZ$) relation in the Gaia bands. We adopted\na sample of 499 DCEPs with metal abundances from high-resolution spectroscopy,\nin conjunction with Gaia Early Data Release 3 parallaxes and photometry to\ncalibrate a $PWZ$ relation in the Gaia bands.

By applying ANODE to the positions, proper motions, and photometry of\nstars observed by Gaia, Via Machinae obtains a collection of those stars deemed\nmost likely to belong to a stellar stream. We further apply an automated\nline-finding method based on the Hough transform to search for line-like\nfeatures in patches of the sky. In this paper, we describe the Via Machinae\nalgorithm in detail and demonstrate our approach on the prominent stream GD-1.\nThough some parts of the algorithm are tuned to increase sensitivity to cold\nstreams, the Via Machinae technique itself does not rely on astrophysical\nassumptions, such as the potential of the Milky Way or stellar isochrones. This\nflexibility suggests that it may have further applications in identifying other\nanomalous structures within the Gaia dataset, for example debris flow and\nglobular clusters.</td>

Our aim is determining their main physical\nparameters, such as reddening and extinction, metallicity, age, total\nluminosity, mean cluster proper motions (PMs), distances, in order to unveil\ntheir physical nature. We study the clusters using optical and near-infrared\n(NIR) datasets. We use the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) PMs in order to\nperform a PM-decontamination procedure and build final catalogues. We match the\nGaia EDR3 with the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea extended (VVVX) survey\nand Two Micron All Sky survey (2MASS) in the NIR, in order to construct\ncomplete colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and investigate the clusters\nproperties. The extinctions are evaluated using existing reddening maps,\nspanning $0.09\lesssim A_{Ks}\lesssim 0.86$ mag and $0.89 \lesssim\nA_{G}\lesssim 4.72$ mag in the NIR and optical, respectively. We obtain their\nheliocentric distances, that range from about 4 to 20 kpc, placing these\nclusters at $3\lesssim R_{G}\lesssim 14$ kpc from the Galactic centre. The best\nPARSEC isochrone fit yields a metallicity range of $-1.8<$[Fe/H]$<+0.3$ and an\napproximative age range of $2<$Age$<14$ Gyr. We find that all clusters have\nlow-luminosities, with $-6.9<M_{V}<-3.5$ mag. Based on our photometric\nanalysis, we confirm the OC nature for Kronberger100, while we classify\nPatchick125 as a metal-poor GC, Ferrero54 as a metal-rich GC, and ESO92-18 as a\npossible old OC or young GC. The classification as GC candidates is also\nsuggested for Kronberger99, Patchick122, Patchick126, Riddle15, FSR190 and\nGaia2.

From this map,\nwe identify previously undetected features in the age-metallicity distribution\nof disc stars and interpret these results as indicating a three-phase formation\nhistory of the Milky Way. In the first phase, inner disc stars form along a\nsingle age-metallicity sequence and are today kinematically hot. The end of\nthis phase is marked by a local minimum in the inner disc age distribution 10\nGyr ago. At this time, we find the stellar populations to transition from high\nto low alpha-element abundances and from high to low vertical velocity\ndispersion. In the second phase, stars form across the disc with outwardly\ndecreasing metallicity. In this phase, inner disc stars form at super-solar\nmetallicites in a continuation of the early age-metallicity relation while\nouter disc stars begin forming at metallicities at least 0.5 dex lower.\nFinally, the third phase is associated with a recent burst of star formation\nacross the local disc marked by a local minimum in the age-metallicity\ndistribution 4 to 6 Gyr ago. Future quantitative comparisons between the\nobserved age-metallicity distribution and those of simulated galaxies could\nhelp constrain the processes driving each of the star formation phases.</td>

      <td>Stars in the Local Galactic Thick Disk and Halo in Gaia EDR3: A catalogue of Half a Million Local Main-sequence Stars with Photometric Metallicities</td>
      <td>We present a catalogue of 551,214 main-sequence stars in the local ($d < 2$\nkpc) Galactic thick disk and halo, based on a search of stars with large proper\nmotions ($\mu_{\mathrm{tot}} > 40.0$ mas/yr) in the Gaia Early Data Release 3.\nWe derive photometric metallicity calibrated from the\ncolour-luminosity-metallicity distribution of 20,047 stars with spectroscopic\nmetallicities, collected from various spectroscopic surveys, including SDSS\nSEGUE/APOGEE, GALAH DR3, and LAMOST DR6. We combine these results to construct\nan empirical colour-magnitude-metallicity grid, which can be used to estimate\nphotometric metallicities for low-mass metal-poor stars of K and M subtypes\nfrom their absolute $G$ magnitude and colour values. We find that low-mass,\nhigh-velocity stars in our catalogue share similar kinematics as reported in\nrecent studies of more luminous Galactic halo stars. The pseudo-kinematic\nanalysis of our sample recovers the main local halo structures, including the\nGaia-Enceladus Stream and the Helmi stream; aside from these the local halo\nstars appear to show a remarkably smooth distribution in velocity space. Since\nthe future Gaia data release will provide radial velocity measurements for only\na small number of our sample, our catalogue provides targets of high interest\nfor the future spectroscopic observation programs like SDSS-V, DESI MW survey,\nWEAVE, and/or 4MOST.</td>

The resulting catalogue contains 71,755 RRLs with period and\nlight curve parameter measurements and has completeness of 0.92 and purity of\n0.92 with respect to the SOS \textit{Gaia} DR2 RRLs. The catalogue covers the\nNorthern sky with declination $\geq -28^\circ$, its completeness is $\gtrsim\n0.8$ for heliocentric distance $\leq 80$~kpc, and the most distant RRL at\n132~kpc. Compared with several other RRL catalogues covering the Northern sky,\nour catalogue has more RRLs around the Galactic halo and is more complete at\nlow Galactic latitude areas. Analysing the spatial distribution of RRL in the\ncatalogue reveals the previously known major over-densities of the Galactic\nhalo, such as the Virgo over-density and the Hercules-Aquila Cloud, with some\nevidence of an association between the two. We also analyse the Oosterhoff\nfraction differences throughout the halo, comparing it with the density\ndistribution, finding increasing Oosterhoff I fraction at the elliptical radii\nbetween 16 and 32 kpc and some evidence of different Oosterhoff fractions\nacross various halo substructures.</td>

      <td>A classifier for spurious astrometric solutions in Gaia EDR3</td>
      <td>The Gaia early Data Release 3 has delivered exquisite astrometric data for\n1.47 billion sources, which is revolutionizing many fields in astronomy. For a\nsmall fraction of these sources, the astrometric solutions are poor, and the\nreported values and uncertainties may not apply. Before any analysis, it is\nimportant to recognize and excise these spurious results - this is commonly\ndone by means of quality flags in the Gaia catalog. Here, we devise a means of\nseparating 'good' from 'bad' astrometric solutions that is an order of\nmagnitude cleaner than any single flag: 99.3% pure and 97.3% complete, as\nvalidated on our test data. We devise an extensive sample of manifestly bad\nastrometric solutions, with parallax that is negative at > 4.5 sigma; and a\ncorresponding sample of presumably good solutions, including sources in HEALPix\npixels on the sky that do not contain such negative parallaxes, and sources\nthat fall on the main sequence in a color-absolute magnitude diagram. We then\ntrain a neural network that uses 17 pertinent Gaia catalog entries and\ninformation about nearby sources to discriminate between these two samples,\ncaptured in a single 'astrometric fidelity' parameter. A diverse set of\nverification tests shows that our approach works very cleanly, including for\nsources with positive parallaxes. The main limitations of our approach are in\nthe very low-SNR and the crowded regime. Our astrometric fidelities for all of\neDR3 can be queried via the Virtual Observatory, our code and data are public.</td>

Its stellar stream still poses serious\nmodelling challenges, which hinders our ability to use it effectively as a\nprobe of the MW gravitational potential. Our goal is to construct the best\npossible sample of stars with which we can advance our understanding of the\nSgr-MW interaction, focusing on the characterisation of the bifurcations. We\nimprove on previous methods based on the use of the wavelet transform to\nsystematically search for the kinematic signature of the Sgr stream in the Gaia\ndata. We refine our selection via the use of a clustering algorithm on the\nstatistical properties of the colour-magnitude diagrams. Our final sample\ncontains > 700k candidate stars, 3x larger than previous samples. We have been\nable to detect the bifurcation of the stream in both the northern and southern\nhemispheres, requiring four branches to fully describe this system. We present\nthe detailed proper motion distribution of the trailing arm as a function of\nLambda showing the presence of a sharp edge (on the side of the small proper\nmotions) beyond which there are no Sgr stars. We also characterise the\ncorrelation between kinematics and distance. The chemical analysis of our\nsample shows a significant difference between the faint and bright branches. We\nprovide analytical descriptions for the proper motion trends as well as for the\nsky distribution of the four branches of the stream. We interpret the\nbifurcations as the misaligned overlap of the material stripped at the\nantepenultimate pericentre (faint branches) with the stars ejected at the\npenultimate pericentre (bright branch). The source of this misalignment is\nstill unknown but we argue that models with some internal rotation in the\nprogenitor, at least during the time of stripping of the stars in the faint\nbranches, are worth exploring.</td>

      <td>Chemo-kinematics of the Milky Way spiral arms and bar resonances: connection to ridges and moving groups in the Solar vicinity</td>
      <td>Using of a new N-body simulation, as well as Gaia DR2/EDR3 data complemented\nby data from the Galah, APOGEE, LAMOST surveys, we explore the possible link\nbetween the MW spiral arms, RVphi-ridges and moving groups in local UV space.\nWe show that the tightly wound main spiral arms in the N-body model can be\nsuccessfully identified using overdensities in angular momentum (AM) or guiding\nspace, as well as in the distribution of dynamically cold stars close to their\nguiding centers. Stars in the AM overdensities that travel over many kpc in\nradius trace extended density ridges in RVphi space and overdensities in the UV\nplane of a SNd-like region, similar to those observed in the Gaia data.\nSimilarly, the AM space of the MW contains several overdensities which\ncorrelate with a wave-like radial velocity pattern; this pattern is also\nreproduced by stars well beyond the SNd. We find that the fraction of Gaia\nstars located near their guiding centers shows three large-scale structures\nthat approximately coincide with the MW spiral arms traced by distributions of\nmaser sources in the Sagittarius, Local, and Perseus arms. Similar to the\nmodel, the stars in the AM overdensities follow the main RVphi ridges. When\nthese ridges cross the SNd, they can be matched with the main UV features. Thus\nwe suggest that the Hat is the inner tail of the Perseus arm, one of the\nHercules components is the Sagittarius arm and the Arcturus stream is likely to\nbe the outermost tail of the Scutum-Centaurus arm. Based on previous work, the\nbar corotation is suggested to coincide with the Hercules stream, and the OLR\nwith the Sirius stream. The latter is supported by a sharp decrease of the mean\nmetallicity beyond the Sirius stream, which is an expected behaviour of the\nOLR. In various phase-space coordinates the AM overdensities stars have\nsystematically higher mean metallicity...(Abridged)</td>

      <td>High-precision chemical abundances of Galactic building blocks. The distinct chemical abundance sequence of Sequoia</td>
      <td>Context: Sequoia is a retrograde kinematic substructures in the nearby\nGalactic halo, whose properties are a matter of debate. For example, previous\nstudies do not necessarily agree on the chemical abundances of Sequoia stars,\nwhich are important for understanding its nature. Aim: We characterize the\nchemical properties of a sample of stars from Sequoia by determining\nhigh-precision abundances. Methods: We measure abundances of Na, Mg, Si, Ti,\nCr, Mn, Ni, Zn, Y, and Ba from a differential abundance analysis on high\nsignal-to-noise ratio, high-resolution spectra from new observations and from\narchival data. We compare precisely-measured chemical abundances of 12 Sequoia\ncandidates with those of typical halo stars from literature, which include also\nstars from Gaia-Enceladus. This allows us to characterize Sequoia and compare\nit to another Galactic building block. The comparison is made after putting all\nthe abundances onto the same scale using standard stars. Results: There are\nsignificant difference in [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and\n[Y/Fe] between Sequoia and Gaia-Enceladus stars at $-1.8\lesssim\n[\mathrm{Fe/H}]\lesssim -1.4$ in the sense that these abundance ratios are\nlower in Sequoia. These differences are similar to those seen between\nGaia-Enceladus and in-situ stars at higher metallicity, suggesting that Sequoia\nis affected by type~Ia supernovae at lower metallicity than Gaia-Enceladus. We\nalso confirm that the low [Mg/Fe] of Sequoia is seen in literature and in\nsurveys, namely APOGEE DR16 and GALAH DR3, if the stars are kinematically\nselected in the same way. Conclusion: Sequoia stars have a distinct chemical\nabundance pattern and can be chemically separated from in-situ stars or\nGaia-Enceladus stars if abundances are measured with sufficient precision,\nnamely $\sigma([\mathrm{X/Fe}])\lesssim 0.07\,\mathrm{dex}$.</td>

      <td>Hot Jupiters, cold kinematics: High phase space densities of host stars reflect an age bias</td>
      <td>Context. The birth environments of planetary systems are thought to influence\nplanet formation and orbital evolution, through external photoevaporation and\nstellar flybys. Recent work has claimed observational support for this, in the\nform of a correlation between the properties of planetary systems and the local\nGalactic phase space density of the host star. In particular, Hot Jupiters are\nfound overwhelmingly around stars in regions of high phase space density, which\nmay reflect a formation environment with high stellar density. Aims. We instead\ninvestigate whether the high phase space density may have a galactic kinematic\norigin: Hot Jupiter hosts may be biased towards being young and therefore\nkinematically cold, because tidal inspiral leads to the destruction of the\nplanets on Gyr timescales, and the velocity dispersion of stars in the Galaxy\nincreases on similar timescales. Methods. We use 6D positions and kinematics\nfrom Gaia for the Hot Jupiter hosts and their neighbours, and construct\ndistributions of the phase space density. We investigate correlations between\nthe stars' local phase space density and peculiar velocity. Results. We find a\nstrong anticorrelation between the phase space density and the host star's\npeculiar velocity with respect to the Local Standard of Rest. Therefore, most\nstars in "high-density" regions are kinematically cold, which may be caused by\nthe aforementioned bias towards detecting Hot Jupiters around young stars\nbefore the planets' tidal destruction. Conclusions. We do not find evidence in\nthe data for Hot Jupiter hosts preferentially being in phase space\noverdensities compared to other stars of similar kinematics, nor therefore for\ntheir originating in birth environments of high stellar density.</td>

      <td>Identifying resonances of the Galactic bar in Gaia DR2: II. Clues from angle space</td>
      <td>The Milky Way disk exhibits intricate orbit substructure of still-debated\ndynamical origin. The angle variables $(\theta_\phi,\theta_R)$ -- which are\nconjugates to the actions $(L_z,J_R)$, and describe a star's location along its\norbit -- are a powerful diagnostic to identify $l$:$m$ resonances via the orbit\nshape relation $\Delta \theta_R / \Delta \theta_\phi = -m/l$. In the past,\nangle signatures have been hidden by survey selection effects (SEs). Using test\nparticle simulations of a barred galaxy, we demonstrate that \emph{Gaia} should\nallow us to identify the Galactic bar's Outer Lindblad Resonance ($l=+1, m=2$,\nOLR) in angle space. We investigate strategies to overcome SEs. In the angle\ndata of the \emph{Gaia} DR2 RVS sample, we independently identify four\ncandidates for the OLR and therefore for the pattern speed $\Omega_\text{bar}$.\nThe strongest candidate, $\Omega_\text{bar}\sim1.4\Omega_0$, positions the OLR\nabove the `Sirius' moving group, agrees with measurements from the Galactic\ncenter, and might be supported by higher-order resonances around the\n`Hercules/Horn'. But it misses the classic orbit orientation flip, as discussed\nin the companion study on actions. The candidate\n$\Omega_\text{bar}\sim1.2\Omega_0$ was also suggested by the action-based\nstudy, has the OLR at the `Hat', is consistent with \emph{slow bar} models, but\nstill affected by SEs. Weaker candidates are $\Omega_\text{bar}=1.6\Omega_0$\nand $1.74\Omega_0$. In addition, we show that the stellar angles do not support\nthe `Hercules/Horn' being created by the OLR of a \emph{fast bar}. We conclude\nthat -- to resolve if `Sirius' or `Hat' is related to the bar's OLR -- more\ncomplex dynamical explanations and more extended data with well-behaved SEs are\nrequired.</td>

      <td>Identifying resonances of the Galactic bar in Gaia DR2: I. Clues from action space</td>
      <td>Action space synthesizes the orbital information of stars and is well-suited\nto analyse the rich kinematic substructure of the disc in the \emph{Gaia} DR2\nradial velocity sample (RVS). We revisit the strong perturbation induced in the\nMilky Way (MW) disc by an $m=2$ bar, using test particle simulations and the\nactions $(J_R,L_z,J_z)$ estimated in an axisymmetric potential. These make\nthree useful diagnostics cleanly visible. (1.) We use the well-known\ncharacteristic flip from outward to inward motion at the Outer Lindblad\nResonance (OLR, $l=+1,m=2$), which occurs along the axisymmetric resonance line\n(ARL) in $(L_z,J_R)$, to identify in the \emph{Gaia} action data three\ncandidates for the bar's OLR and pattern speed $\Omega_\text{bar}$:\n$1.85\Omega_0$, $1.20\Omega_0$, and $1.63\Omega_0$ (with $\sim0.1\Omega_0$\nsystematic uncertainty). The \emph{Gaia} data is therefore consistent with both\nslow and fast bar models in the literature, but disagrees with recent\nmeasurements of $\sim1.45\Omega_0$. (2.) For the first time, we demonstrate\nthat bar resonances -- especially the OLR -- cause a gradient in vertical\naction $\langle J_z \rangle$ with $L_z$ around the ARL via "$J_z$-sorting" of\nstars. This could contribute to the observed coupling of $\langle v_R \rangle$\nand $\langle | v_z | \rangle$ in the Galactic disc. (3.) We confirm prior\nresults that the behaviour of resonant orbits is well approximated by\nscattering and oscillation in $(L_z,J_R)$ along a slope $\Delta J_R/\Delta L_z\n= l/m$ centered on the $l$:$m$ ARL.

      <td>Rapid early gas accretion for the inner Galactic disc</td>
      <td>Recent observations of the Milky Way and galaxies at high redshifts suggest\nthat galaxy discs were already in place soon after the Big Bang. While the gas\ninfall history of the Milky Way in the inner disc has long been assumed to be\ncharacterised by a short accretion time scale, this has not been directly\nconstrained using observations. Using the unprecedented amount and quality of\ndata of the inner regions of the Milky Way that has recently been produced by\nAPOGEE and Gaia, we aim to derive strong constraints on the infall history of\nthe inner (less than 6 kpc) Galaxy (with a focus on stars between 4-6 kpc,\nwhich we show is an appropriate proxy for the entire inner disc). We have\nimplemented gas infall into a chemical evolution model of the Galaxy disc, and\nused a Schmidt-Kennicutt law to connect the infall to the star formation. We\nexplore a number of models, and two different formulations of the infall law.\nIn one formulation, the infall is non-parametric, and in the other the infall\nhas an explicitly exponential form. We fit the model parameters to the\ntime-[Si/Fe] distribution of solar vicinity stars, and the metallicity and\n[Si/Fe] distribution function of stars with a galactocentric radius between 4-6\nkpc from APOGEE. Our results point to a fast early gas accretion, with an upper\nlimit of accretion timescale of around 2 Gyr in the inner disc of the Milky\nWay. This suggests that at least half the baryons were in place within 2-3 Gyr\nof the Big Bang, and that half the stars of the inner disc formed within the\nfirst 5 Gyr, during the thick disc formation phase. This implies that the\nstellar mass of the inner disc is dominated by the thick disc, supporting our\nprevious work, and that the gas accretion onto the inner disc was rapid and\nearly.</td>

The\n{\LZ} distributions of our program stars in the panels with different [Fe/H]\nand [$\alpha$/Fe] suggest that the thick-disk consists of two distinct\ncomponents with different chemical compositions and kinematic properties. For\nthe inner region, the metal-weak thick disk (MWTD) contributes significantly\nwhen [$\alpha$/Fe] $>+$0.2\,dex and [Fe/H] $<-$0.8\,dex, while the canonical\nthick-disk (TD) dominates when [Fe/H]$>-$0.8\,dex. However, MWTD clearly\nappears only when [$\alpha$/Fe] $>+$0.2\,dex and [Fe/H] $<-$1.2\,dex for the\nouter region, and its proportion is lower than that of the inner region within\nthe same metallicity. Similar result can be obtained from the {\VP}\ndistribution. The high fraction of MWTD in the inner than that in the outer\nregion imply that MWTD may form in the inner disk, and is an observational\nevidence about the inside-out disk formation scenario.</td>

      <td>The Reduced Proper Motion selected halo: methods and description of the catalogue</td>
      <td>The Gaia mission has provided the largest ever astrometric chart of the Milky\nWay. Using it to map the Galactic halo is helpful for disentangling its merger\nhistory. The identification of halo stars in Gaia DR2 with reliable distance\nestimates requires special methods because such stars are typically farther\naway and scarce. We apply the reduced proper motion (RPM) method to identify\nhalo main sequence stars on the basis of Gaia photometry and proper motions.\nUsing the colour-absolute-magnitude relation for this type of stars, we\ncalculate photometric distances. Our selection results in a set of $\sim10^7$\ntentative main sequence halo stars with typical distance uncertainties of $7\%$\nand with median velocity errors of 20 km/s. The median distance of our sample\nis $\sim 4.4$ kpc, with the faintest stars located at $\sim 16$ kpc. The\nspatial distribution of the stars in our sample is centrally concentrated.\nVisual inspection of the mean velocities of stars on the sky reveals\nlarge-scale patterns as well as clear imprints of the GD-1 stream and tentative\nhints of the Jhelum and Leiptr streams. Incompleteness and selection effects\nlimit our ability to interpret the patterns reliably as well as to identify new\nsubstructures. We define a pseudo-velocity space by setting to zero the\nline-of-sight velocities of our sample stars. In this space, we recover several\nknown structures such as the footprint of Gaia-Enceladus (i.e. the\nGaia-Sausage) as well as the Helmi streams and some other retrograde\nsubstructures (Sequoia, Thamnos). We show that the two-point velocity\ncorrelation function reveals significant clustering on scales smaller than 100\nkm/s, of similar amplitude as found for the 6D Gaia halo sample. This\nclustering indicates the presence of nearby streams that are predominantly\nphase-mixed.</td>

      <td>Gaia-ESO Survey: Detailed elemental abundances in red giants of the peculiar globular cluster NGC 1851</td>
      <td>Context. NGC 1851 is one of several globular clusters for which multiple\nstellar populations of the subgiant branch have been clearly identified and a\ndifference in metallicity detected. A crucial piece of information on the\nformation history of this cluster can be provided by the sum of A(C+N+O)\nabundances. However, these values have lacked a general consensus thus far. The\nseparation of the subgiant branch can be based on age and/or A(C+N+O) abundance\ndifferences. Aims. Our main aim was to determine carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen\nabundances for evolved giants in the globular cluster NGC1851 in order to check\nwhether or not the double populations of stars are coeval. Methods.\nHigh-resolution spectra, observed with the FLAMES-UVES spectrograph on the ESO\nVLT telescope, were analysed using a differential model atmosphere method.\nResults. We provide abundances of up to 29 chemical elements for a sample of 45\ngiants in NGC 1851. The investigated stars can be separated into two\npopulations with a difference of 0.07 dex in the mean metallicity, 0.3 dex in\nthe mean C/N, and 0.35 dex in the mean s-process dominated element-to-iron\nabundance ratios [s/Fe]. No significant difference was determined in the mean\nvalues of A(C+N+O) as well as in abundance to iron ratios of carbon, alpha- and\niron-peak-elements, and of europium. Conclusions. As the averaged A(C+N+O)\nvalues between the two populations do not differ, additional evidence is given\nthat NGC 1851 is composed of two clusters, the metal-rich cluster being by\nabout 0.6 Gyr older than the metal-poor one. A global overview of NGC 1851\nproperties and the detailed abundances of chemical elements favour its\nformation in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy that was accreted by the Milky Way.</td>

      <td>Interstellar dust affects astronomical observations through absorption and\nreddening, yet this extinction is also a powerful tool for studying\ninterstellar matter in galaxies. 3D reconstructions of dust extinction and\ndensity in the Milky Way have suffered from artefacts such as the\nfingers-of-god effect and negative densities, and have been limited by large\ncomputational costs. Here we aim to overcome these issues with a novel\nalgorithm that derives the 3D extinction density of dust in the Milky Way using\na latent variable Gaussian Process and variational inference. Our model\nmaintains non-negative density and hence monotonically non-decreasing\nextinction along all lines-of-sight, and performs inference within a reasonable\ncomputational time. Using extinctions for hundreds of thousands of stars\ncomputed from optical and near-IR photometry, together with distances based on\nGaia parallaxes, we use our algorithm to infer the structure of the Orion,\nTaurus, Perseus, and Cygnus X star-forming regions. A number of features\nsuperimposed in 2D extinction maps are clearly deblended in 3D dust extinction\ndensity maps. We find a large filament on the edge of Orion, identify filament\nthat in the Taurus and Perseus regions, and show that Cygnus X is located at\n1300-1500pc. We compute dust masses of the regions and find these to be\nslightly higher than previous estimates, likely a consequence of our input data\nrecovering the highest column densities more effectively. Comparing our\npredicted extinctions to Planck data, we find that known relationships between\ndensity and dust processing, where high extinction lines of sight have the most\nprocessed grains, hold up in resolved observations when density is included,\nand that they exist at smaller scales than previously suggested. This can be\nused to study the changes in size or composition of dust as they are processed\nin molecular clouds. (Abridged)</td>

In\nthis theoretical paper we extend previous work in which, making use of the\nepicyclic approximation, the linearized Boltzmann equation had been used to\nexplicitly compute, away from resonances, the perturbed distribution function\nof a Galactic thin-disc population in the presence of a non-axisymmetric\nperturbation of constant amplitude. Here we improve this theoretical framework\nin two distinct ways in the new code that we present. First, we use better\nestimates for the action-angle variables away from quasi-circular orbits,\ncomputed from the AGAMA software, and we present an efficient routine to\nnumerically re-express any perturbing potential in these coordinates with a\ntypical accuracy at the per cent level. The use of more accurate action\nestimates allows us to identify resonances such as the outer 1:1 bar resonance\nat higher azimuthal velocities than the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR), and to\nextend our previous theoretical results well above the Galactic plane, where we\nexplicitly show how they differ from the epicyclic approximation. In\nparticular, the displacement of resonances in velocity space as a function of\nheight can in principle constrain the 3D structure of the Galactic potential.\nSecond, we allow the perturbation to be time dependent, thereby allowing us to\nmodel the effect of transient spiral arms or a growing bar. The theoretical\nframework and tools presented here will be useful for a thorough analytical\ndynamical modelling of the complex velocity distribution of disc stars as\nmeasured by past and upcoming Gaia data releases.</td>

The Gaia catalogue is very appropriate to find members of OCs at\nlarge distance from their centers. We aim at revisiting the membership lists of\nOCs from the solar vicinity, in particular by extending these membership lists\nto the peripheral areas thanks to Gaia EDR3. We used the clustering algorithm\nHDBSCAN on Gaia parallaxes and proper motions to systematically look for\nmembers up to 50 pc from the cluster centers. We fitted a King's function on\nthe radial density profile of these clusters and a Gaussian Mixture Model on\ntheir two dimensional distribution of members. We also evaluated the degree of\nmass segregation of the clusters. Our methodology performs well on 389 clusters\nout of the 467 selected ones. We report the detection of vast coronae around\nalmost all the clusters and the detection of 71 OCs with tidal tails,\nmultiplying by more than four the number of such structures identified. We find\nthe size of the cores to be on average smaller for old clusters than for young\nones. Also, the overall size of the clusters seems to slightly increase with\nage while the fraction of stars in the halo seems to decrease. As expected the\nmass segregation is more pronounced in the oldest clusters but a clear trend\nwith age is not seen. OCs are more extended than previously expected,\nregardless of their age. The decrease in the proportion of stars populating the\nclusters halos highlights the different cluster evaporation processes and the\nshort timescales they need to affect the clusters.

      <td>During the last years and decades several individual studies and large-scale\nspectroscopic surveys significantly improved our knowledge of the Galactic\nmetallicity distribution based on open clusters. The availability of Gaia data\nprovided a further step forward in our knowledge. However, still some open\nissues remain, for example the influence of radial migration on the\ninterpretation of the observed gradients. We used spectroscopic metallicities\nfrom individual studies and from the APOGEE survey to compile a sample of 136\nopen clusters, with a membership verification based on Gaia DR2. Additionally,\nwe present photometric metallicity estimates of 14 open clusters in a somewhat\nouter Galactic region. Eight age groups allow us to study the evolution of the\nmetallicity gradient in detail, showing within the errors an almost constant\ngradient of about $-$0.06 dex kpc$^{-1}$. Furthermore, using the derived\ngradients and an analysis of the individual objects, we estimate a mean\nmigration rate of 1 kpc Gyr$^{-1}$ for objects up to about 2 Gyr. Here, the\nchange of the guiding radius is clearly the main contributor. For older and\ndynamically hotter objects up to 6 Gyr we infer a lower migration rate of up to\n0.5 kpc Gyr$^{-1}$. The influence of epicyclic excursions increases with age\nand contributes already about 1 kpc to the total migration distance after 6\nGyr. A comparison of our results with available models shows good agreement.\nHowever, there is still a lack of a suitable coverage of older objects, future\nstudies are still needed to provide a better sampling in this respect.</td>

      <td>An estimation of the Gaia EDR3 parallax bias from stellar clusters and Magellanic Clouds data</td>
      <td>CONTEXT. The Gaia EDR3 parallaxes constitute the most detailed and accurate\ndataset that can be currently used to determine stellar distances in the solar\nneighborhood. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement in their\ncalibration and systematic effects can be further reduced in some\ncircumstances.\n  AIMS. The aim of this paper is to determine an improved Gaia EDR3 parallax\nbias as a function of magnitude, color, and ecliptic latitude using a single\nmethod applied to stars in open clusters, globular clusters, the LMC, and the\nSMC.\n  METHODS. I study the behavior of the residuals or differences between the\nindividual (stellar) parallaxes and the group parallaxes, which are assumed\nconstant for the corresponding cluster or galaxy. This is done by first\napplying the Lindegren et al. (2021) zero point and then calculating a new zero\npoint from the residuals of the first analysis.\n  RESULTS. The Lindegren zero point shows very small residuals as a function of\nmagnitude between individual and group parallaxes for G < 13 but significant\nones for brighter stars, especially blue ones. The new zero point reduces those\nresiduals, especially in the 9.2 < G < 13 range. The k factor that is used to\nconvert from catalog parallax uncertainties to external uncertainties is small\n(1.1-1.7) for 9.2 < G < 11 and G > 13, intermediate (1.7-2.0) for 11 < G < 13,\nand large (>2.0) for G <9.2. Therefore, significant corrections are needed to\ncalculate distance uncertainties from Gaia EDR3 parallaxes for some stars.\nThere is still room for improvement if future analyses add information from\nadditional stellar clusters, especially for red stars with G < 11 and blue\nstars with G < 9.2. I also calculate k for stars with RUWE values between 1.4\nand 8.0 and for stars with 6-parameter solutions, allowing for a correct\nestiimation of their uncertainties.\n  [ABRIDGED]</td>

      <td>The Milky Way bar and bulge revealed by APOGEE DR16 and Gaia EDR3</td>
      <td>We investigate the inner regions of the Milky Way with a sample of\nunprecedented size and coverage thanks to APOGEE DR16 and Gaia EDR3 data. Our\ninner Galactic sample has more than 26,000 stars within $|X_{\rm Gal}| <5$ kpc,\n$|Y_{\rm Gal}| <3.5$ kpc, $|Z_{\rm Gal}| <1$ kpc, and we also make the analysis\nfor a foreground-cleaned sub-sample of 8,000 stars more representative of the\nbulge-bar populations. The inner Galaxy shows a clear chemical discontinuity in\nkey abundance ratios [$\alpha$/Fe], [C/N], and [Mn/O], probing different\nenrichment timescales, which suggests a star formation gap (quenching) between\nthe high- and low-$\alpha$ populations. For the first time, we are able to\nfully characterize the different populations co-existing in the innermost\nregions of the Galaxy via joint analysis of the distributions of rotational\nvelocities, metallicities, orbital parameters and chemical abundances. The\nchemo-kinematic analysis reveals the presence of the bar; of an inner thin\ndisk; of a thick disk, and of a broad metallicity population, with a large\nvelocity dispersion, indicative of a pressure supported component. We find and\ncharacterize chemically and kinematically a group of counter-rotating stars,\nwhich could be the result of a gas-rich merger event or just the result of\nclumpy star formation during the earliest phases of the early disk, which\nmigrated into the bulge. Finally, based on the 6D information we assign stars a\nprobability value of being on a bar orbit and find that most of the stars with\nlarge bar orbit probabilities come from the innermost 3 kpcs. Even stars with a\nhigh probability of belonging to the bar show the chemical bimodality in the\n[$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] diagram. This suggests bar trapping to be an efficient\nmechanism, explaining why stars on bar orbits do not show a significant\ndistinct chemical abundance ratio signature.</td>

      <td>DECam photometry reveals extra-tidal stars around the Milky Way globular cluster NGC 6864 (M75)</td>
      <td>Globular clusters are prone to lose stars while moving around the Milky Way.\nThese stars escape the clusters and are distributed throughout extended\nenvelopes or tidal tails. However, such extra-tidal structures are not observed\nin all globular clusters, and yet there is no structural or dynamical\nparameters that can predict their presence or absence. NGC\,6864 is an outer\nhalo globular cluster with reported no observed tidal tails. We used Dark\nEnergy Camera (DECam) photometry reaching $\sim$ 4 mag underneath its main\nsequence turnoff to confidently detect an extra-tidal envelope, and stellar\ndebris spread across the cluster outskirts. These features emerged once robust\nfield star filtering techniques were applied to the fainter end of the observed\ncluster main sequence. NGC\,6864 is associated to the {\it Gaia}-Enceladus\ndwarf galaxy, among others 28 globular clusters. Up-to-date, nearly 64$\%$ of\nthem have been targeted looking for tidal tails and most of them have been\nconfirmed to exhibit tidal tails. Thus, the present outcomes allow us to\nspeculate on the possibility that {\it Gaia}-Enceladus globular clusters share\na common pattern of mass loss by tidal disruption.</td>

      <td>Age Determination of Galaxy Merger Remnant Stars using Asteroseismology</td>
      <td>The Milky Way was shaped by the mergers with several galaxies in the past. We\nsearch for remnant stars that were born in these foreign galaxies and assess\ntheir ages in an effort to put upper limits on the merger times and thereby\nbetter understand the evolutionary history of our Galaxy. Using 6D-phase space\ninformation from Gaia eDR3 and chemical information from APOGEE DR16, we\nkinematically and chemically select $23$ red giant stars belonging to former\ndwarf galaxies that merged with the Milky Way. With added asteroseismology from\nKepler and K2, we determine the ages of the $23$ ex-situ stars and $55$ in-situ\nstars with great precision. We find that all the ex-situ stars are consistent\nwith being older than $8$ Gyr. While it is not possible to associate all the\nstars with a specific dwarf galaxy we classify eight of them as\nGaia-Enceladus/Sausage stars, which is one of the most massive mergers in our\nGalaxy's history. We determine their mean age to be $9.5^{+1.2}_{-1.3}$ Gyr\nconsistent with a merger time of $8$-$10$ Gyr ago. The rest of the stars are\npossibly associated with Kraken, Thamnos, Sequoia, or another extragalactic\nprogenitor. The age determination of ex-situ stars paves the way to more\naccurately pinning down when the merger events occurred and hence provide tight\nconstraints useful for simulating how these events unfolded.</td>

      <td>Precise distances from OGLE-IV member RR Lyrae stars in six bulge globular clusters</td>
      <td>Context. RR Lyrae stars are useful standard candles allowing one to derive\naccurate distances for old star clusters. Based on the recent catalogues from\nOGLE-IV and Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3), the distances can be improved for\na few bulge globular clusters. Aims. The aim of this work is to derive an\naccurate distance for the following six moderately metal-poor, relatively\nhigh-reddening bulge globular clusters: NGC 6266, NGC 6441, NGC 6626, NGC 6638,\nNGC 6642, and NGC 6717. Methods. We combined newly available OGLE-IV catalogues\nof variable stars containing mean I magnitudes, with Clement's previous\ncatalogues containing mean V magnitudes, and with precise proper motions from\nGaia EDR3. Astrometric membership probabilities were computed for each RR\nLyrae, in order to select those compatible with the cluster proper motions.\nApplying luminosity-metallicity relations derived from BaSTI $\alpha$-enhanced\nmodels (He-enhanced for NGC 6441 and canonical He for the other clusters), we\nupdated the distances with relatively low uncertainties. Results. Distances\nwere derived with the I and V bands, with a $5-8\%$ precision. We obtained 6.6\nkpc, 13.1 kpc, 5.6 kpc, 9.6 kpc, 8.2 kpc, and 7.3 kpc for NGC 6266, NGC 6441,\nNGC 6626, NGC 6638, NGC 6642, and NGC 6717, respectively. The results are in\nexcellent agreement with the literature for all sample clusters, considering\nthe uncertainties. Conclusions. The present method of distance derivation,\nbased on recent data of member RR Lyrae stars, updated BaSTI models, and robust\nstatistical methods, proved to be consistent. A larger sample of clusters will\nbe investigated in a future work.</td>

We have combined these new observations with all relevant IRAC archival\ndata of these fields in order to produce the deepest possible mosaics of these\nregions. In total, these observations represent nearly 11% of the total Spitzer\nmission time. The resulting mosaics cover a total of approximately 71.5deg$^2$\nin the 3.6 and 4.5um bands, and approximately 21.8deg$^2$ in the 5.8 and 8um\nbands. They reach at least 24 AB magnitude (measured to sigma, in a 2.5 arcsec\naperture) in the 3.6um band and up to ~ 5 mag deeper in the deepest regions.\nThe astrometry is tied to the Gaia astrometric reference system, and the\ntypical astrometric uncertainty for sources with 16<[3.6]<19 is <0.15 arcsec.\nThe photometric calibration is in excellent agreement with previous WISE\nmeasurements. We have extracted source number counts from the 3.6um band\nmosaics and they are in excellent agreement with previous measurements. Given\nthat the Spitzer Space Telescope has now been decommissioned these mosaics are\nlikely to be the definitive reduction of these IRAC data. This survey therefore\nrepresents an essential first step in assembling multi-wavelength data on the\nEuclid deep fields which are set to become some of the premier fields for\nextragalactic astronomy in the 2020s.</td>

The two aims of this paper are to revise the results for the sample\nfrom paper I using Gaia EDR3 data and to expand the sample of analyzed stellar\ngroups to 26, from Villafranca O-001 to Villafranca O-026.\n  METHODS. We use GOSSS to select Galactic stellar groups with O stars and an\nupdated version of the method in paper 0 of this series, combining Gaia EDR3\nG+GBP+GRP photometry, positions, proper motions, and parallaxes to assign\nmemberships and measure distances. We present 99 spectra from GOSSS and 32 from\nLiLiMaRlin for stars in the analyzed groups or in their foreground.\n  RESULTS. We derive distances to the 26 stellar groups with unprecedented\nprecision and accuracy, with total uncertainties <1% within 1 kpc and of ~3%\naround 3 kpc, values that are almost 4x better than for Gaia DR2. We provide\nhomogeneous spectral types for 110 stars and correct a number of errors in the\nliterature, especially for objects in the Orion nebula cluster. For each of the\ngroups we discuss its membership and present possible runaway/walkaway stars.\nAt least two groups, Villafranca O-O12 S and Villafranca O-014 NW, are orphan\nclusters in which the most massive stars have been ejected by dynamical\ninteractions, leaving objects with a capped mass function. The existence of\nsuch clusters has important consequences for the study of the IMF, the\ndistribution of SNe across the Galaxy, and the population and dynamics of\nisolated compact objects.

The sample is constructed by extending an\nexisting blue-selected catalogue, and cross-matching with Gaia EDR3 astrometry.\nThe observed pattern of proper motions is modulated into a saw-tooth pattern,\nwith full amplitude approaching 1 mas yr$^{-1}$, recurring roughly every 2--3\ndegrees of longitude (200--300 pc at the median OB-star distance of 5.8 kpc).\nKinematic perturbation of underlying circular rotation is most likely present.\nThe data also reveal a moving group containing $>50$ OB stars at $\ell \sim\n286^{\circ}$, $b \sim -1^{\circ}.4$ behind the main run of the far arm. An\nanalysis of relative proper motions is performed that yields an incidence of\nrunaway O stars of at least 10\% (potentially $>20$\% when full space motions\nbecome available). To map where runaways have run away from, we set up\nsimulations for the region that assume linear trajectories and test for\ntrajectory impact parameter in order to identify likely ejection hot spots. We\nfind the method currently gives good results for times of flight of up to\n$\sim$4 Myr. It shows convincingly that only NGC 3603 and Westerlund 2 have\nejected OB stars in significant numbers. Indeed, both clusters have experienced\nintense spells of ejection between 0.6--0.9 and 0.5--0.8 Myr ago, respectively.</td>

Only cases in the low, 37.5,\n40 ${\rm\,km\,s^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$, and high, 55, 57.5\n${\rm\,km\,s^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$, velocity ranges give trapping structures that\nhave some similarity with observed features in the velocity distribution.

Our best approximation to the local velocity field by orbital\ntrapping is obtained with a bar angular velocity of 40\n${\rm\,km\,s^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$ and a bar angle of 40${^\circ}$. With this\nsolution, three main observed features can be approximated: i) the Hercules\nbranch at V=$-50$ ${\rm\,km\,s^{-1}}$ produced by the resonance 8/1 outside\ncorotation, and the close features produced by resonances 5/1 and 6/1, ii) the\nnewly detected low-density arch at V $\simeq$ 40 ${\rm\,km\,s^{-1}}$ produced\napproximately by the resonance 4/3, iii) the inclined structure below the\nHercules branch, also observed in the $\textit{Gaia}$ DR2 data, produced by\ntube orbits around Lagrange point $L_5$ at corotation. Some predicted\ncontributions due to orbital trapping in regions of the U-V plane corresponding\nto the Galactic halo are given, which could help to further restrict the value\nof the angular velocity of the Galactic bar.

      <td>FSR 1776: a new globular cluster in the Galactic bulge?</td>
      <td>(ABRIDGED) Recent near-IR surveys have uncovered a plethora of new globular\ncluster (GC) candidates towards the Milky Way bulge. These new candidates need\nto be confirmed as real GCs and properly characterised. We investigate the\nphysical nature of FSR 1776. This object was originally classified as an\nintermediate-age open cluster and has recently been re-discovered independently\nand classified as a GC candidate (Minni 23). Firstly, we aim at confirming its\nGC nature; secondly we determine its physical parameters. The confirmation of\nthe cluster existence is checked using the radial velocity (RV) distribution of\na MUSE data cube centred at FSR 1776. The cluster parameters are derived from\nisochrone fitting to the RV-cleaned colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) from\nvisible and near-infrared photometry. The predicted RV distribution for the FSR\n1776 coordinates, considering only contributions from the bulge and disc field\nstars, is not enough to explain the observed MUSE RV distribution. The extra\npopulation (12\% of the sample) is FSR 1776 with an average RV of $-103.7\pm\n0.4~{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$.

      <td>The Pristine survey XIII: Uncovering the very metal-poor tail of the thin disc</td>
      <td>We evaluate the rotational velocity of stars observed by the Pristine survey\ntowards the Galactic anticentre, spanning a wide range of metallicities from\nthe extremely metal-poor regime ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-3$) to nearly solar\nmetallicity. In the Galactic anticentre direction, the rotational velocity\n($V_{\phi}$) is similar to the tangential velocity in the galactic longitude\ndirection ($V_{\ell}$). This allows us to estimate $V_{\phi}$ from Gaia early\ndata-release 3 (Gaia EDR3) proper motions for stars without radial velocity\nmeasurements. This substantially increases the sample of stars in the outer\ndisc with estimated rotational velocities. Our stellar sample towards the\nanticentre is dominated by a kinematical thin disc with a mean rotation of\n$\sim -220$ km $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. However, our analysis reveals the presence of\nmore stellar substructures. The most intriguing is a well populated extension\nof the kinematical thin disc down to $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} \sim -2$. A scarser fast\nrotating population reaching the extremely metal-poor regime, down to\n$\mathrm{[Fe/H]} \sim -3.5$ is also detected, but without statistical\nsignificance to unambiguously state whether this is the extremely metal-poor\nextension of the thin disc or the high rotating tail of hotter structures (like\nthe thick disc or the halo). In addition, a more slowly rotating kinematical\nthick disc component is also required to explain the observed $V_{\ell}$\ndistribution at $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} > -1.5$. Furthermore, we detect signatures of\na "heated disc", the so-called Splash, at metallicities higher than $\sim-1.5$.\nFinally, at $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} < -1.5$ our anticentre sample is dominated by a\nkinematical halo with a net prograde motion.</td>

We find that the streams are split into\nsubstructures in integrals of motion space, most notably into two clumps in\nangular momentum space. The clumps have consistent metallicity distributions\nand stellar populations, supporting a common progeny. In all the realistic\nGalactic potentials explored, the Helmi streams stars depict a diffuse\ndistribution close to Omega_z /Omega_R ~0.7. At the same time, the reason for\nthe substructure in angular momentum space appears to be a Omega_z : Omega_phi\nresonance close to the 1:1. This resonance is exactly the 1:1 in the case that\nthe (density) flattening of the dark halo is q = 1.2. For this halo shape the\nsubstructure in angular momenta is also long lasting.

Here we use these\nimproved values of stellar parameters to build a library of observed spectra\nwhich is useful to study variations of individual spectral lines with stellar\nparameters. This and other improvements are used to derive radial velocities\nwith uncertainties which are generally within 0.1 km/s or ~25% smaller than in\nthe previous release. Median differences in radial velocities measured here and\nby the Gaia DR2 or APOGEE DR16 surveys are smaller than 30 m/s, a larger offset\nis present only for Gaia measurements of giant stars. We identify 4483 stars\nwith intrinsically variable velocities and 225 stars for which the velocity\nstays constant over >=3 visits spanning more than a year. The combination of\nradial velocities from GALAH+ with distances and sky plane motions from Gaia\nenables studies of dynamics within streams and clusters. For example, we\nestimate that the open cluster M67 has a total mass of ~3300 Msun and its outer\nparts seem to be expanding, though astrometry with a larger time-span than\ncurrently available from Gaia eDR3 is needed to judge if the latter result is\nreal.</td>

      <td>Hidden in the Haystack: Low-luminosity globular clusters towards the Milky Way bulge</td>
      <td>Recent wide-area surveys have enabled us to study the Milky Way with\nunprecedented detail. Its inner regions, hidden behind dust and gas, have been\npartially unveiled with the arrival of near-IR photometric and spectroscopic\ndatasets. Among recent discoveries, there is a population of low-mass globular\nclusters, known to be missing, especially towards the Galactic bulge. In this\nwork, five new low-luminosity globular clusters located towards the bulge area\nare presented. They were discovered by searching for groups in the\nmulti-dimensional space of coordinates, colours, and proper motions from the\nGaia EDR3 catalogue and later confirmed with deeper VVV survey near-IR\nphotometry. The clusters show well-defined red-giant branches and, in some\ncases, horizontal branches with their members forming a dynamically coherent\nstructure in proper motion space. Four of them were confirmed by spectroscopic\nfollow-up with the MUSE instrument on the ESO VLT. Photometric parameters were\nderived, and when available, metallicities, radial velocities and orbits were\ndetermined. The new clusters Gran 1 and 5 are bulge globular clusters, while\nGran 2, 3, and 4 present halo-like properties. Preliminary orbits indicate that\nGran 1 might be related to the Main Progenitor, or the so-called ''low-energy''\ngroup, while Gran 2, 3 and 5 appear to follow the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage. This\nstudy demonstrates that the Gaia proper motions, combined with the\nspectroscopic follow-up and colour-magnitude diagrams, are required to confirm\nthe nature of cluster candidates towards the inner Galaxy. High stellar\ncrowding and differential extinction may hide other low-luminosity clusters.</td>

These samples are used to characterize the\nGSE and Sequoia population metallicity distribution functions, elemental\nabundance patterns, age distributions, and progenitor masses. We find that the\nGSE population has a mean [Fe/H] $\sim -1.15$ and a mean age of $10-12$ Gyr.\nGSE has a single sequence in [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] consistent with the onset of SN\nIa Fe contributions and uniformly low [Al/Fe] of $\sim -0.25$ dex. The derived\nproperties of the Sequoia population are strongly dependent on the kinematic\nselection. We argue the selection with the least contamination is\n$J_{\phi}/J_{\mbox{tot}} < -0.6$ and $(J_z - J_R)/J_{\mbox{tot}} < 0.1$. This\nresults in a mean [Fe/H] $\sim -1.3$ and a mean age of $12-14$ Gyr. The Sequoia\npopulation has a complex elemental abundance distribution with mainly high\n[Mg/Fe] stars. We use the GSE [Al/Fe] vs [Mg/H] abundance distribution to\ninform a chemically-based selection of accreted stars, which is used to remove\npossible contaminant stars from the GSE and Sequoia samples.</td>

This observed trend, along\nwith a mild anticorrelation of the mean rotational velocity with metallicity\n($\Delta \langle v_\phi \rangle / \Delta \langle{\rm[Fe/H]} \rangle \sim -10$\nkm s$^{-1}$ dex$^{-1}$), implies that more metal-rich stars in the inner region\nof the GSE progenitor were gradually stripped away, while the prograde orbit of\nthe merger at infall became radialized by dynamical friction. The metal-rich\nGSE stars are causally disconnected from the Splash structure, whose stars are\nmostly found on prograde orbits ($>94\%$) and exhibit a more centrally\nconcentrated distribution than GSE. The MWTD exhibits a similar spatial\ndistribution to the Splash, suggesting earlier dynamical heating of stars in\nthe primordial disk of the Milky Way, possibly before the GSE merger.</td>

We study the link between the local\nhalo kinematic groups and three of these stellar clouds: the Hercules-Aquila\ncloud, the Virgo Overdensity, and the Eridanus-Phoenix overdensity. We perform\norbital integrations in a standard Milky Way potential of a local halo sample\nextracted from Gaia eDR3, with the goal of predicting the location of the\nmerger debris elsewhere in the Galaxy. We specifically focus on the regions\noccupied by the three stellar clouds and compare their kinematic and distance\ndistributions with those predicted from the orbits of the nearby debris. We\nfind that the local halo substructures have families of orbits that tend to\npile up in the regions where the stellar clouds have been found. The distances\nand velocities of the cloud's member stars are in good agreement with those\npredicted from the orbit integrations, particularly for Gaia-Enceladus stars.\nThis is the dominant contributor of all three overdensities, with a minor part\nstemming from the Helmi streams and to an even smaller extent from Sequoia.

We demonstrate the efficacy of\nour method through application to Gaia EDR3 photometry and astrometry in the\ndirection of NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen), a highly challenging target on account of\nits Galactic latitude ($b\approx 15^{\circ}$) and low proper motion contrast\nwith the surrounding field. We recover the spectacular tidal extensions,\nspanning the $10^{\circ}$ on the sky explored here, seen in earlier work and\nquantify the star count profile and ellipticity of the system out to a\ncluster-centric radius of $4^{\circ}$. We show that both RR Lyrae and blue\nhorizontal branch stars consistent with belonging to $\omega$ Cen are found in\nthe tidal tails, and calculate that these extensions contain at least $\approx\n0.1$ per cent of the total stellar mass in the system. Our high probability\nmembers provide prime targets for future spectroscopic studies of $\omega$ Cen\nout to unprecedented radii.</td>

      <td>Towards Realistic Modeling of the Astrometric Capabilities of MCAO Systems: Detecting an Intermediate Mass Black Hole with MAVIS</td>
      <td>Accurate astrometry is a key deliverable for the next generation of\nmulti-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) systems. The MCAO Visible Imager and\nSpectrograph (MAVIS) is being designed for the Very Large Telescope Adaptive\nOptics Facility and must achieve 150 $\mu$as astrometric precision (50 $\mu$as\ngoal). To test this before going on-sky, we have created MAVISIM, a tool to\nsimulate MAVIS images. MAVISIM accounts for three major sources of astrometric\nerror, high- and low-order point spread function (PSF) spatial variability,\ntip-tilt residual error and static field distortion. When exploring the impact\nof these three error terms alone, we recover an astrometric accuracy of 50\n$\mu$as for all stars brighter than $m=19$ in a 30s integration using\nPSF-fitting photometry. We also assess the feasibility of MAVIS detecting an\nintermediate mass black hole (IMBH) in a Milky Way globular cluster. We use an\nN-body simulation of an NGC 3201-like cluster with a central 1500 M$_{\odot}$\nIMBH as input to MAVISIM and recover the velocity dispersion profile from\nproper motion measurements. Under favourable astrometric conditions, the\ndynamical signature of the IMBH is detected with a precision of ~0.20 km/s in\nthe inner ~4" of the cluster where HST is confusion-limited. This precision is\ncomparable to measurements made by Gaia, HST and MUSE in the outer ~60" of the\ncluster. This study is the first step towards building a science-driven\nastrometric error budget for an MCAO system and a prediction of what MAVIS\ncould do once on sky.</td>

In the framework of Galactic\nformation and evolution, we discuss the complex relationships between age,\nmetallicity, [$\alpha$/Fe], and the velocity components. We study stars with\nmeasured chemical, seismic and astrometric properties from the APOGEE survey,\nthe Kepler and Gaia satellites, respectively. We separate the\n[$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] diagram into 3 stellar populations: the thin disc, the\nhigh-$\alpha$ metal-poor thick disc and the high-$\alpha$ metal-rich thick disc\nand characterise each of these in the age-chemo-kinematics parameter space. We\ncompare results obtained from different APOGEE data releases and using two\nrecent age determinations. We use the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy model (BGM) to\nhighlight selection biases and mechanisms not included in the model. The thin\ndisc exhibits a flat age-metallicity relation while [$\alpha$/Fe] increases\nwith stellar age. We confirm no correlation between radial and vertical\nvelocities with [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe] and age for each stellar population.\nConsidering both samples, V$_\varphi$ decreases with age for the thin disc,\nwhile it increases with age for the h$\alpha$mp thick disc. Although the age\ndistribution of the h$\alpha$mr thick disc is very close to that of the\nh$\alpha$mp thick disc between 7 and 14 Gyr, its kinematics seems to follow\nthat of the thin disc. This feature, not predicted by the hypotheses included\nin the BGM, suggests a different origin and history for this population.\nFinally, we show that there is a maximum dispersion of the vertical velocity,\n$\sigma_Z$, with age for the h$\alpha$mp thick disc around 8 Gyr. The\ncomparisons with the BGM simulations suggest a more complex chemo-dynamical\nscheme to explain this feature, most likely including mergers and radial\nmigration effects</td>

      <td>Physical characterization of recently discovered globular clusters in the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy II. Metallicities, ages and luminosities</td>
      <td>Globular clusters (GCs) are important tools to rebuild the accretion history\nof a galaxy. There are newly discovered GCs in the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf\ngalaxy, that can be used as probes of the accretion event onto the Milky Way\n(MW). Our main aim is to characterize the Sgr GC system by measuring its main\nphysical parameters. We build the optical and near-IR color-magnitude diagrams\n(CMDs) for 21 new Sgr GCs using the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea Extended\nSurvey (VVVX) near-IR database combined with the Gaia EDR3 optical database. We\nderive metallicities and ages for all targets, using the isochrone-fitting\nmethod and the RGB-slope and metallicity relation. The total luminosities are\ncalculated both in the near-IR and in the optical. We construct the metallicity\ndistribution (MD), the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF), and the\nage-metallicity relation for the Sgr GC system. We find 17 metal-rich GCs with\n-0.9<[Fe/H]<-0.3, 4 metal-poor GCs with -2.0<[Fe/H]<-1.1 in the new Sgr GC\nsample. Even though our age estimates are rough, we find that the metal-poor\nGCs are consistent with an old population with an average age of ~13 Gyr, while\nthe metal-rich GCs show a wider age range, between 6-8 Gyr and 10-13 Gyr. We\ncompare the MD and the GCLF for the Sgr GC system with those of the MW, M31 and\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxies. We conclude that the majority of the\nmetal-rich GCs are located within the main body of Sgr galaxy. We confirm that\nthe GCLF is not a universal distribution, since the Sgr GCLF peaks at fainter\nluminosities than the GCLFs of the MW, M31 and LMC. The MD shows a\ndouble-peaked distribution, and we note that the metal-rich population looks\nlike the MW bulge GCs. We compared our results with the literature concluding\nthat the Sgr progenitor could have been a reasonably large galaxy able to\nretain the SNe ejecta, thus enriching its ISM.</td>

      <td>Evidence of a dwarf galaxy stream populating the inner Milky Way Halo</td>
      <td>Stellar streams produced from dwarf galaxies provide direct evidence of the\nhierarchical formation of the Milky Way. Here, we present the first\ncomprehensive study of the "LMS-1" stellar stream, that we detect by searching\nfor wide streams in the Gaia EDR3 dataset using the STREAMFINDER algorithm.\nThis stream was recently discovered by Yuan et al. (2020). We detect LMS-1 as a\n$60\deg$ long stream to the north of the Galactic bulge, at a distance of $\sim\n20$ kpc from the Sun, together with additional components that suggest that the\noverall stream is completely wrapped around the inner Galaxy. Using\nspectroscopic measurements from LAMOST, SDSS and APOGEE, we infer that the\nstream is very metal poor (${\rm \langle [Fe/H]\rangle =-2.1}$) with a\nsignificant metallicity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]}=0.4$), and it\npossesses a large radial velocity dispersion (${\rm \sigma_v=20 \pm\n4\,km\,s^{-1}}$). These estimates together imply that LMS-1 is a dwarf galaxy\nstream. The orbit of LMS-1 is close to polar, with an inclination of $75\deg$\nto the Galactic plane. Both the orbit and metallicity of LMS-1 are remarkably\nsimilar to the globular clusters NGC 5053, NGC 5024 and the stellar stream\n"Indus". These findings make LMS-1 an important contributor to the stellar\npopulation of the inner Milky Way halo.</td>

The\nNGC 6522 abundance pattern can give hints on the earliest chemical enrichment\nin the central Galaxy. The aim of this study is to derive abundances of the\nlight elements C and N; alpha elements O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti; odd-Z elements Na\nand Al; neutron-capture elements Y, Zr, Ba, La, and Nd; and the r-process\nelement Eu. We verify if there are first- and second-generation stars: we find\nclear evidence of Na-Al, Na-N, and Mg-Al correlations, while we cannot identify\nthe Na-O anti-correlation from our data. High-resolution spectra of six red\ngiants in the bulge globular cluster NGC 6522 were obtained at the 8m VLT\nUT2-Kueyen telescope in FLAMES+UVES configuration. In light of Gaia data, it\nturned out that two of them are non-members, but these were also analysed.\nSpectroscopic parameters were derived through the excitation and ionisation\nequilibrium of FeI and FeII lines from UVES spectra. The abundances were\nobtained with spectrum synthesis. The present analysis combined with previous\nUVES results gives a mean radial velocity of vrhel = -15.62+-7.7 km.s-1 and a\nmetallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.05+-0.20 for NGC 6522. Mean abundances of alpha\nelements for the present four member stars are enhanced with\n  [O/Fe]=+0.38, [Mg/Fe]=+0.28, [Si/Fe]=+0.19, and [Ca/Fe]=+0.13, together with\nthe iron-peak element [Ti/Fe]=+0.13, and the r-process element\n[Eu/Fe]=+0.40.The neutron-capture elements Y, Zr, Ba, and La show enhancements\nin the +0.08 < [Y/Fe] < +0.90, 0.11 < [Zr/Fe] < +0.50, 0.00 < [Ba/Fe] < +0.63,\n0.00 < [La/Fe] < +0.45, and -0.10 < [Nd/Fe] < +0.70 ranges.

This characterization is consistent with the\npopulation of ultra-faint satellites, and confirmation of this system would\nmake Centaurus I one of the brightest recently discovered ultra-faint dwarf\ngalaxies. Centaurus I is detected in Gaia DR2 with a clear and distinct proper\nmotion signal, confirming that it is a real association of stars distinct from\nthe Milky Way foreground; this is further supported by the clustering of blue\nhorizontal branch stars near the centroid of the system. The second system,\nDELVE 1 (DELVE J1630-0058), is identified as a resolved overdensity of stars\nwith a heliocentric distance of ${\rm D}_{\odot} = 19.0_{-0.6}^{+0.5} kpc$, a\nhalf-light radius of $r_h = 0.97_{-0.17}^{+0.24}$ arcmin, an age of $\tau =\n12.5_{-0.7}^{+1.0}$ Gyr, a metallicity of $Z = 0.0005_{-0.0001}^{+0.0002}$, and\nan absolute magnitude of $M_V = -0.2_{-0.6}^{+0.8}$ mag, consistent with the\nknown population of faint halo star clusters. Given the low number of probable\nmember stars at magnitudes accessible with Gaia DR2, a proper motion signal for\nDELVE 1 is only marginally detected. We compare the spatial position and proper\nmotion of both Centaurus I and DELVE 1 with simulations of the accreted\nsatellite population of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and find that neither\nis likely to be associated with the LMC.</td>

      <td>The structure and evolution of the spiral arms of our Milky Way are basic but\nlong-standing questions in astronomy. In particular, the lifetime of spiral\narms is still a puzzle and has not been well constrained from observations. In\nthis work, we aim to inspect these issues using a large catalogue of open\nclusters. We compiled a catalogue of 3794 open clusters based on Gaia EDR3. A\nmajority of these clusters have accurately determined parallaxes, proper\nmotions, and radial velocities. The age parameters for these open clusters are\ncollected from references or calculated in this work. In order to understand\nthe nearby spiral structure and its evolution, we analysed the distributions,\nkinematic properties, vertical distributions, and regressed properties of\nsubsamples of open clusters. We find evidence that the nearby spiral arms are\ncompatible with a long-lived spiral pattern and might have remained\napproximately stable for the past 80 million years. In particular, the Local\nArm, where our Sun is currently located, is also suggested to be long-lived in\nnature and probably a major arm segment of the Milky Way. The evolutionary\ncharacteristics of nearby spiral arms show that the dynamic spiral mechanism\nmight be not prevalent for our Galaxy. Instead, density wave theory is more\nconsistent with the observational properties of open clusters.</td>

Our simulations predict, in\ncontrast to what is deduced from the data, that such a cluster should present\nstrong and extended tidal tails by more than 6 Gyr ago (right after the first\nthird of its life), exceeding 1 kpc of length, and should be roughly disrupted\nby current time. We analyzed each of our initial conditions, such as initial\nmass and density parameters, as well as the dark matter shape, and we argue\nthat the most likely reason for such discrepancy between the data and our\nsimulations is related to the fact that we consider a purely baryonic cluster\nin the beginning of each model we test. We discuss that if our globular cluster\nwas initially embedded in a dark matter minihalo, the latter could act as a\nprotecting envelope, which prevents the tidal stripping of the luminous matter,\nwhile being itself gradually disrupted and removed in the course of the cluster\nevolution. This could explain why an insignificant amount of dark matter is\nrequired to describe the velocity dispersion in NGC~6397, up to at least a few\nhalf-mass radii.</td>

At the same time, we use the selection of cluster members to explore\nthe reliability and limitations of the Gaia catalogue itself. We find that the\nformal uncertainties on parallax and PM are underestimated by 10-20% in dense\ncentral regions even for stars that pass numerous quality filters. We explore\nthe the spatial covariance function of systematic errors, and determine a lower\nlimit on the uncertainty of average parallaxes and PM at the level 0.01 mas and\n0.025 mas/yr, respectively. Finally, a comparison of mean parallaxes of\nclusters with distances from various literature sources suggests that the\nparallaxes (after applying the zero-point correction suggested by Lindegren et\nal. 2021) are overestimated by 0.01+-0.003 mas.

One feature in nearly all modern models of the Milky Way is\nthe Sagittarius Arm, located inward of the Sun with a pitch angle of ~12 deg.\nAims: We map the 3D locations and velocities of star-forming regions in a\nsegment of the Sagittarius Arm using young stellar objects (YSOs) from the\nSpitzer/IRAC Candidate YSO (SPICY) catalog to compare their distribution to\nmodels of the arm. Methods: Distances and velocities for these objects are\nderived from Gaia EDR3 astrometry and molecular line surveys. We infer\nparallaxes and proper motions for spatially clustered groups of YSOs and\nestimate their radial velocities from the velocities of spatially associated\nmolecular clouds. Results: We identify 25 star-forming regions in the Galactic\nlongitude range l~4.0-18.5 deg arranged in a narrow, ~1 kpc long linear\nstructure with a high pitch angle of $\psi = 56$ deg and a high aspect ratio of\n~7:1. This structure includes massive star-forming regions such as M8, M16,\nM17, and M20. The motions in the structure are remarkably coherent, with\nvelocities in the direction of Galactic rotation of $240\pm3$ km/s (slightly\nhigher than average) and slight drifts toward the Galactic center (-4.3 km/s)\nand in the negative Z direction (-2.9 km/s). The rotational shear experienced\nby the structure is 4.6 km/s/kpc. Conclusions: The observed 56 deg pitch angle\nis remarkably high for a segment of the Sagittarius Arm. We discuss possible\ninterpretations of this feature as a substructure within the lower pitch angle\nSagittarius Arm, as a spur, or as an isolated structure.</td>

      <td>The GALAH Survey: Accreted stars also inhabit the Spite Plateau</td>
      <td>The ESA Gaia astrometric mission has enabled the remarkable discovery that a\nlarge fraction of the stars near the Solar neighbourhood appear to be debris\nfrom a single in-falling system, the so-called Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GSE).\nOne exciting feature of this result is that it gives astronomers for the first\ntime a large sample of easily observable unevolved stars that formed in an\nextra-Galactic environment, which can be compared to stars that formed within\nour Milky Way. Here we use these stars to investigate the "Spite Plateau" --\nthe near-constant lithium abundance observed in metal-poor dwarf stars across a\nwide range of metallicities (-3<[Fe/H]<-1). In particular our aim is to test\nwhether the stars that formed in the GSE show a different Spite Plateau to\nother Milky Way stars that inhabit the disk and halo. Individual galaxies could\nhave different Spite Plateaus -- e.g., the ISM could be more depleted in\nlithium in a lower galactic mass system due to it having a smaller reservoir of\ngas. We identified 76 GSE dwarf stars observed and analyzed by the GALactic\nArcheology with HERMES (GALAH) survey as part of its Third Data Release.\nOrbital actions were used to select samples of Gaia-Enceladus stars, and\ncomparison samples of halo and disk stars. We find that the Gaia-Enceladus\nstars show the same lithium abundance as other likely accreted stars and in\nsitu Milky Way stars, strongly suggesting that the "lithium problem" is not a\nconsequence of the formation environment. This result fits within the growing\nconsensus that the Spite Plateau, and more generally the "cosmological lithium\nproblem" -- the observed discrepancy between the amount of lithium in warm,\nmetal-poor dwarf stars in our Galaxy, and the amount of lithium predicted to\nhave been produced by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis -- is the result of lithium\ndepletion processes within stars.</td>

      <td>Our aim was to determine the initial Li content of two clusters of similar\nmetallicity but very different ages, the old open cluster NGC 2243 and the\nmetal-rich globular cluster NGC 104. We compared the lithium abundances derived\nfor a large sample of stars (from the turn-off to the red giant branch) in each\ncluster. For NGC 2243 the Li abundances are from the catalogues released by the\nGaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey, while for NGC 104 we measured the Li\nabundance using FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra, which include archival data and new\nobservations. We took the initial Li of NGC 2243 to be the lithium measured in\nstars on the hot side of the Li dip. We used the difference between the initial\nabundances and the post first dredge-up Li values of NGC 2243, and by adding\nthis amount to the post first dredge-up stars of NGC~104 we were able to infer\nthe initial Li of this cluster. Moreover, we compared our observational results\nto the predictions of theoretical stellar models for the difference between the\ninitial Li abundance and that after the first dredge-up. The initial lithium\ncontent of NGC 2243 was found to be A(Li)_i = 2.85dex by taking the average Li\nabundance measured from the five hottest stars with the highest lithium\nabundance. This value is 1.69 dex higher than the lithium abundance derived in\npost first dredge-up stars. By adding this number to the lithium abundance\nderived in the post first dredge-up stars in NGC~104, we infer a lower limit of\nits initial lithium content of A(Li)_i= 2.30dex. Stellar models predict similar\nvalues. Therefore, our result offers important insights for further theoretical\ndevelopments.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Galactic evolution of lithium from iDR6</td>
      <td>We exploit the unique characteristics of a sample of open clusters (OCs) and\nfield stars for which high-precision 7Li abundances and stellar parameters are\nhomogeneously derived by the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES). We derive possibly\nundepleted 7Li abundances for 26 OCs and star forming regions with ages from\nyoung to old spanning a large range of Galactocentric distances, which allows\nus to reconstruct the local late Galactic evolution of lithium as well as its\ncurrent abundance gradient along the disc. Field stars are added to look\nfurther back in time and to constrain 7Li evolution in other Galactic\ncomponents. The data are then compared to theoretical tracks from chemical\nevolution models that implement different 7Li forges. We find that the upper\nenvelope of the 7Li abundances measured in field stars of nearly solar\nmetallicities traces very well the level of lithium enrichment attained by the\nISM as inferred from observations of cluster stars. We confirm previous\nfindings that the abundance of 7Li in the solar neighbourhood does not decrease\nat supersolar metallicity. The comparison of the data with the chemical\nevolution model predictions favours a scenario in which the majority of the 7Li\nabundance in meteorites comes from novae. Current data also seem to suggest\nthat the nova rate flattens out at later times. This requirement might have\nimplications for the masses of the white dwarf nova progenitors and deserves\nfurther investigation. Neutrino-induced reactions taking place in core-collapse\nsupernovae also produce some fresh lithium. This likely makes a negligible\ncontribution to the meteoritic abundance, but could be responsible for a mild\nincrease of the 7Li abundance in the ISM of low-metallicity systems that would\ncounterbalance the astration processes.</td>

      <td>The AMBRE Project: Solar neighbourhood chemodynamical constraints on Galactic disc evolution</td>
      <td>We analysed the chemodynamical evolution of the Galactic disc using precise\n[Mg/Fe] abundances from a previous study and accurate Gaia data. For this\npurpose, we estimated ages and dynamical properties for 366 MSTO solar\nneighbourhood stars from the AMBRE Project using PARSEC isochrones together\nwith astrometric and photometric values from Gaia DR2. We find a radial\ngradient of -0.099 ${\pm}$ 0.031 dex kpc$^{-1}$ for [M/H] and +0.023 ${\pm}$\n0.009 dex kpc for the [Mg/Fe] abundance. The steeper [Mg/Fe] gradient than that\nfound in the literature is a result of the improvement of the AMBRE [Mg/Fe]\nestimates in the metal-rich regime. In addition, we find a significant spread\nof stellar age at any given [Mg/Fe] value, and observe a clear correlated\ndispersion of the [Mg/Fe] abundance with metallicity at a given age. While for\n[M/H] < -0.2, a clear age-[Mg/Fe] trend is observed, more metal-rich stars\ndisplay ages from 3 up to 12 Gyr, describing an almost flat trend in the\n[Mg/Fe]-age relation. Moreover, we report the presence of radially migrated\nstars for a wide range of stellar ages, although we note the large\nuncertainties of the amplitude of the inferred change in orbital guiding radii.\nFinally, we observe the appearance of a second chemical sequence in the outer\ndisc, 10-12 Gyr ago, populating the metal-poor, low-[Mg/Fe] tail. These stars\nare more metal-poor than the coexisting stellar population in the inner parts\nof the disc, and show lower [Mg/Fe] abundances than prior disc stars of the\nsame metallicity, leading to a chemical discontinuity. Our data favour the\nrapid formation of an early disc that settled in the inner regions, followed by\nthe accretion of external metal-poor gas -- probably related to a major\naccretion event such as the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage one -- that may have\ntriggered the formation of the thin disc population and steepened the abundance\ngradient in the early disc.</td>

      <td>An Intriguing Globular Cluster in the Galactic Bulge from the VVV Survey</td>
      <td>Recent near-IR Surveys have discovered a number of new bulge globular cluster\n(GC) candidates that need to be further investigated. Our main objective is to\nuse public data from the Gaia Mission, VVV, 2MASS and WISE in order to measure\nthe physical parameters of Minni48, a new candidate GC located in the inner\nbulge of the Galaxy at l=359.35 deg, b=2.79 deg. Even though there is a bright\nforeground star contaminating the field, the cluster appears quite bright in\nnear- and mid-IR images. We obtain deep decontaminated optical and near-IR\ncolour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for this cluster. The heliocentric cluster\ndistance is determined from the red clump (RC) and the red giant branch (RGB)\ntip magnitudes in the near-IR CMD, while the cluster metallicity is estimated\nfrom the RGB slope and the fit to theoretical isochrones. The GC size is found\nto be r = 6' +/- 1', while reddening and extinction values are E(J-Ks)=0.60 +/-\n0.05 mag, A_G=3.23 +/- 0.10 mag, A_Ks=0.45 +/- 0.05 mag. The resulting mean\nGaia proper motions are PMRA=-3.5 +/- 0.5 mas/yr, PMDEC=-6.0 +/- 0.5 mas/yr.\nThe IR magnitude of the RC yields an accurate distance modulus estimate of\n(m-M)_0=14.61 mag, equivalent to a distance D=8.4 +/- 1.0 kpc. This is\nconsistent with the optical distance estimate: (m-M)_0=14.67 mag, D=8.6 +/- 1.0\nkpc, and with the RGB tip distance: (m-M)_0=14.45 mag, D=7.8 +/- 1.0 kpc. The\nderived metallicity is [Fe/H]=-0.20 +/- 0.30 dex. A good fit to the PARSEC\nstellar isochrones is obtained in all CMDs using Age = 10 +/- 2 Gyr. The total\nabsolute magnitude of this GC is estimated to be M_Ks= -9.04 +/- 0.66 mag.\nBased on its position, kinematics, metallicity and age, we conclude that\nMinni48 is a genuine GC, similar to other well known metal-rich bulge GCs. It\nis located at a projected Galactocentric angular distance of 2.9 deg,\nequivalent to 0.4 kpc, being one of the closest GCs to the Galactic centre.</td>

      <td>NGC 1261: an $r$-process enhanced globular cluster from the Gaia-Enceladus event</td>
      <td>Our Milky Way (MW) has witnessed a series of major accretion events. One of\nthe later additions, Gaia-Enceladus, has contributed a considerable mass to the\ninner Galaxy, but also generously donated to the outer halo. So far,\nassociations with present-day MW globular clusters (GCs) have been chiefly\nbased on their kinematics and ages. Here, we present a chemical abundance study\nof the outer halo (R$_{\rm GC}$=18 kpc) GC NGC 1261, which has been suggested\nto be an accreted object. We measured 31 species of 29 elements in two stars\nfrom high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra and find that the cluster is\nmoderately metal poor, at [Fe/H]=-1.26. NGC 1261 is moderately\n$\alpha$-enhanced to the 0.3-dex level. While from the small sample alone it is\ndifficult to assert any abundance correlations, the light elements Na,O,Mg, and\nAl differ significantly between the two stars in contrast to the majority of\nother elements with smaller scatter; this argues in favour of multiple\ngenerations of stars coexisting in this GC. Intriguingly for its metallicity,\nNGC 1261 shows heavy element abundances that are consistent with $r$-process\nnucleosynthesis and we discuss their origin in various sites. In particular the\nEu overabundance quantitatively suggests that one single $r$-process event,\nsuch as a neutron-star neutron-star merger or a rare kind of supernova, can be\nresponsible for the stellar enhancement or even the enrichment of the cluster\nwith the excess $r$-material. Its heavy element pattern makes NGC 1261 resemble\nthe moderately enhanced r-I stars that are commonly found in the halo and have\nbeen detected in Gaia-Enceladus as well. Therefore, combining all kinematical,\nage, and chemical evidence we conclude that NGC 1261 is a chemically intriguing\nGC that was born in Gaia-Enceladus and has been subsequently accreted into the\nMW halo.

Using a\ncombination of data from Nissen & Schuster (2010), the 3rd GALAH data release\n(with 1D NLTE abundance corrections) and APOGEE data release 16, we fit\nanalytic chemical evolution models to a 9-dimensional chemical abundance space\n(Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn) in particular focusing on the iron-peak\nelements, Mn and Ni. We find that low [Mn/Fe] $\sim-0.15\,\mathrm{dex}$ and low\n[Ni/Fe] $\sim-0.3\,\mathrm{dex}$ Type Ia yields are required to explain the\nobserved trends beyond the [$\alpha$/Fe] knee of the Gaia Sausage\n(approximately at [Fe/H] $=-1.4\,\mathrm{dex}$). Comparison to theoretical\nyield calculations indicate a significant contribution from sub-Chandrasekhar\nmass Type Ia supernovae in this system (from $\sim60$% to $100$% depending on\nthe theoretical model with an additional $\pm10$% systematic from NLTE\ncorrections). We compare to results from other Local Group environments\nincluding dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the Magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way's\nbulge, finding the Type Ia [Mn/Fe] yield must be metallicity-dependent. Our\nresults suggest that sub-Chandrasekhar mass channels are a significant, perhaps\neven dominant, contribution to Type Ia supernovae in metal-poor systems, whilst\nmore metal-rich systems could be explained by metallicity-dependent\nsub-Chandrasekhar mass yields, possibly with additional progenitor mass\nvariation related to star formation history, or an increased contribution from\nChandrasekhar mass channels at higher metallicity.</td>

Therefore, they are relatively\nfaint and difficult to map. However, deep near-infrared photometry like that\nprovided by the VISTA Variables in the Via L\'actea Extended Survey (VVVX) is\nallowing us to map GCs in this crucial yet relatively uncharted region.\n  Our results confirm with high confidence that both FSR 19 and FSR 25 are\ngenuine MW bulge GCs. Each of the performed tests and resulting parameters\nprovides clear evidence for the GC nature of these targets. We derive distances\nof 7.2$\pm$0.7 kpc and D=7.0$\pm$0.6 (corresponding to distance moduli of\n14.29$\pm$0.08 and\n  14.23$\pm$0.07) for FSR 19 and FSR 25, respectively. Their ages and\nmetallicities are 11 Gyr and [Fe/H]= -0.5 dex for both clusters, which were\ndetermined from Dartmouth and PARSEC isochrone fitting. The integrated\nluminosities are M$_{Ks}$(FSR 19) = -7.72 mag and M$_{Ks}$(FSR 25) = -7.31 mag\nwhich places them in the faint tail of the GC Luminosity Function. By adopting\na King profile for their number distribution, we determine their core and tidal\nradii ($r_c$, $r_t$). For FSR 19, r$_{c}$= 2.76$\pm$0.36 pc and\nr$_{t}$=5.31$\pm$0.49 pc, while FSR 25 appears more extended with r$_{c}$=\n1.92$\pm$0.59 pc and r$_{t}$=6.85$\pm$1.78 pc. Finally their mean GC PMs (from\nGaia EDR3) are $\mu_{\alpha^\ast}$= -2.50 $\pm$0.76 mas $yr^{-1}$,\n$\mu_{\delta}$= -5.02 $\pm$0.47 mas $yr^{-1}$ and $\mu_{\alpha^\ast}$= -2.61\n$\pm$ 1.27 mas $yr^{-1}$ , $\mu_{\delta}$= -5.23 $\pm$0.74 mas $yr^{-1}$ for\nFSR 19 and FSR 25, respectively. }</td>

Part of this work involves\nthe use of OCs and the derivation of their precise and accurate chemical\ncomposition.We analyze here a sample of OCs located within about 2 kpc from the\nSun, with ages from about 50 Myr to a few Gyr.We used HARPS-N at the Telescopio\nNazionale Gaileo and collected very high-resolution spectra (R = 115\,000) of\n40 red giant/red clump stars in 18 OCs (16 never or scarcely studied plus two\ncomparison clusters). We measured their radial velocities and derived the\nstellar parameters.We discussed the relationship between metallicity and\nGalactocentric distance, adding literature data to our results to enlarge the\nsample and taking also age into account. We compared the result of\nobservational data with that from chemo-dynamical models. These models\ngenerally reproduce the metallicity gradient well. However, at young ages we\nfound a large dispersion in metallicity, not reproduced by models. Several\npossible explanations are explored, including uncertainties in the derived\nmetallicity. We confirm the difficulties in determining parameters for young\nstars (age < 200 Myr), due to a combination of intrinsic factors which\natmospheric models can not easily reproduce and which affect the parameters\nuncertainty</td>

      <td>The vertical distribution of stars in the solar neighbourhood is not in\nequilibrium but contains a wave signature in both density and velocity space\noriginating from a perturbation. With the discovery of the phase-space spiral\nin Gaia data release 2, determining the origin of this perturbation has become\neven more urgent. We develop and test a fast method for calculating the\nperturbation from a passing satellite on the vertical component of a part of a\ndisc galaxy. This fast method allows us to test a large variety of possible\nperturbations to the vertical disc very quickly. We apply our method to the\nrange of possible perturbations to the solar neighbourhood stemming from the\nrecent passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr), varying its mass, mass\nprofile, and present-day position within their observational uncertainties, and\nits orbit within different realistic models for the Milky Way's gravitational\npotential. We find that we are unable to reproduce the observed asymmetry in\nthe vertical number counts and its concomitant breathing mode in velocity space\nfor any plausible combination of Sgr and Milky-Way properties. In all cases,\neither the amplitude or the perturbation wavelength of the number-count\nasymmetry and of the oscillations in the mean vertical velocity produced by the\npassage of Sgr is in large disagreement with the observations from Gaia DR2. We\nconclude that Sgr cannot have caused the observed oscillations in the vertical\ndisc or the Gaia phase-space spiral.</td>

      <td>Non-equilibrium in the Solar Neighbourhood using dynamical modelling with Gaia DR2</td>
      <td>Matter distribution models of the Milky Way galaxy are usually stationary,\nalthough there are known to be wave-like perturbations in the disc at\n$\sim10\%$ level of the total density. Modelling of the overall acceleration\nfield by allowing non-equilibrium is a complicated task. We must learn to\ndistinguish whether density enhancements are persistent or not by their nature.\nIn the present paper, we elaborate our orbital arc method to include the\neffects of massless perturbations and non-stationarities in the modelling. The\nmethod is tested by modelling of simulation data and shown to be valid. We\napply the method to the Gaia DR 2 data within a region of $\sim 0.5$ kpc from\nthe Sun and confirm that acceleration field in the Solar Neighbourhood has a\nperturbed nature -- the phase space density along the orbits of stars grow in\nthe order of $h\lesssim 5\%$ per Myr due to non-stationarity. This result is a\ntemporally local value and can be used only within the timeframe of a few Myrs.\nAn attempt to pinpoint the origin of the perturbation shows that the stars\nhaving larger absolute angular momentum are the main carriers of the local\nperturbation. As they are faster than the average thin disc star, they are\neither originating further away and are close in their pericentre or they are\nperturbed locally by a fast co-moving perturber, such as gas disc\ninhomogenities.</td>

      <td>Context. The Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy is merging with the Milky Way,\nand the study of its globular clusters (GCs) is important to understand the\nhistory and outcome of this ongoing process. Aims. Our main goal is to\ncharacterize the GC system of the Sgr dwarf galaxy. This task is hampered by\nhigh foreground stellar contamination, mostly from the Galactic bulge. Methods.\nWe performed a GC search specifically tailored to find new GC members within\nthe main body of this dwarf galaxy using the combined data of the VISTA\nVariables in the Via Lactea Extended Survey (VVVX) near-infrared survey and the\nGaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) optical database. Results. We applied proper\nmotion (PM) cuts to discard foreground bulge and disk stars, and we found a\nnumber of GC candidates in the main body of the Sgr dwarf galaxy. We selected\nthe best GCs as those objects that have significant overdensities above the\nstellar background of the Sgr galaxy and that possess color-magnitude diagrams\n(CMDs) with well-defined red giant branches (RGBs) consistent with the distance\nand reddening of this galaxy. Conclusions. We discover eight new GC members of\nthe Sgr galaxy, which adds up to 29 total GCs known in this dwarf galaxy. This\ntotal number of GCs shows that the Sgr dwarf galaxy hosts a rather rich GC\nsystem. Most of the new GCs appear to be predominantly metal-rich and have low\nluminosity. In addition, we identify ten other GC candidates that are more\nuncertain and need more data for proper confirmation.</td>

      <td>Discovery of a new nearby globular cluster with extreme kinematics located in the extension of a halo stream</td>
      <td>Context. We report the discovery of VVV-CL160, a new nearby globular cluster\n(GC) with extreme kinematics, located in the Galactic plane at $l = 10.1477$\ndeg, $b = 0.2999$ deg. Aims. We aim to characterize the physical properties of\nthis new GC and place it in the context of the Milky Way, exploring its\npossible connection with the known GC NGC 6544 and with the Hrid halo stream.\nMethods. VVV-CL160 was originally detected in the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia\nL\'actea (VVV) survey. We use the proper motions (PMs) from the updated VVV\nInfrared Astrometric Catalog (VIRAC2) to select GC members and make deep\nnear-infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to study the cluster properties.\nWe also fit King models to the decontaminated sample to determine the GC\nstructural parameters. Results. VVV-CL160 has an unusually large PM for a\nGalactic GC as measured with VIRAC2 and Gaia EDR3: $\mu_{\alpha}\cos(\delta)$ =\n$-2.3 \pm 0.1 $ mas yr$^{-1}$ and $\mu_{\delta}$ = $-16.8 \pm 0.1 $ mas\nyr$^{-1}$. The kinematics are similar to those of the known GC NGC 6544 and the\nHrid halo stream. We estimate a reddening of $E(J-K) = 1.95$ mag and an\nextinction of $A_{k}= 1.40$ mag for VVV-CL160. We also measure a distance\nmodulus of $(m-M) = 13.01$ mag and a distance of $D_{\odot} = 4.0 \pm 0.5$ kpc.\nThis places the GC at $z=29$ pc above the Galactic plane and at a\ngalactocentric distance of $R_G=4.2$ kpc. We also measure a metallicity of\n$[Fe/H] = -1.4 \pm 0.2$ dex for an adopted age of $t=12$ Gyr; King model fits\nof the PM-decontaminated sample reveal a concentrated GC, with core radius\n$r_{c}= 22.8"$ and tidal radius $r_{t}= 50'$. .... We also explore the possible\nassociation of this new GC with other GCs and halo streams. Conclusions. Based\non the locations and kinematics, we suggest that VVV-CL160, along with NGC\n6544, may be associated with the extension of the Hrid halo stream.</td>

      <td>A Parametric Galactic Model toward the Galactic Bulge Based on Gaia and Microlensing Data</td>
      <td>We developed a parametric Galactic model toward the Galactic bulge by fitting\nto spatial distributions of the Gaia DR2 disk velocity, VVV proper motion,\nBRAVA radial velocity, OGLE-III red clump star count, and OGLE-IV star count\nand microlens rate, optimized for use in microlensing studies. We include the\nasymmetric drift of Galactic disk stars and the dependence of velocity\ndispersion on Galactic location in the kinematic model, which has been ignored\nin most previous models used for microlensing studies. We show that our model\npredicts a microlensing parameter distribution significantly different from\nthose typically used in previous studies. We estimate various fundamental model\nparameters for our Galaxy through our modeling, including the initial mass\nfunction (IMF) in the inner Galaxy. Combined constraints from star counts and\nthe microlensing event timescale distribution from the OGLE-IV survey, in\naddition to a prior on the bulge stellar mass, enable us to successfully\nmeasure IMF slopes using a broken power-law form over a broad mass range,\n$\alpha_{\rm bd}=0.22^{+0.20}_{-0.55}$ for $M<0.08\,M_{\odot}$, $\alpha_{\rm\nms} = 1.16^{+0.08}_{-0.15}$ for $0.08\,M_{\odot}\leq\,M<M_{\rm br}$, and\n$\alpha_{\rm hm} = 2.32^{+0.14}_{-0.10}$ for $M\geq\,M_{\rm br}$, as well as a\nbreak mass at $M_{\rm br} = 0.90^{+0.05}_{-0.14} \, M_{\odot}$. This is\nsignificantly different from the Kroupa IMF for local stars, but similar to the\nZoccali IMF measured from a bulge luminosity function. We also estimate the\ndark matter mass fraction in the bulge region of $28\pm7$\% which could be\nlarger than a previous estimate. Because our model is purely parametric, it can\nbe universally applied using the parameters provided in this paper.</td>

      <td>Linking globular cluster structural parameters and their evolution: multiple stellar populations</td>
      <td>Globular clusters (GCs) are known to host multiple stellar populations\nshowing chemical anomalies in the content of light elements. The origin of such\nanomalies observed in Galactic GCs is still debated. Here we analyse data\ncompiled from the Hubble Space Telescope, ground-based surveys and Gaia DR2 and\nexplore relationships between the structural properties of GCs and the fraction\nof second population (2P) stars. Given the correlations we find, we conclude\nthat the main factor driving the formation/evolution of 2P stars is the cluster\nmass. The existing strong correlations between the 2P fraction and the\nrotational velocity and concentration parameter could derive from their\ncorrelation with the cluster mass. Furthermore, we observe that increasing\ncluster escape velocity corresponds to higher 2P fractions. Each of the\ncorrelations found is bimodal, with a different behaviour detected for low and\nhigh mass (or escape velocity) clusters. These correlations could be consistent\nwith an initial formation of more centrally concentrated 2P stars in deeper\ncluster potentials, followed by a long-term tidal stripping of stars from\nclusters outskirts. The latter are dominated by the more extended distributed\nfirst population (1P) stars, and therefore stronger tidal stripping would\npreferentially deplete the 1P population, raising the cluster 2P fraction. This\nalso suggests a tighter distribution of initial 2P fractions than observed\ntoday. In addition, higher escape velocities allow better retention of\nlow-velocity material ejected from 1P stars, providing an\nalternative/additional origin for the observed differences and the\ndistributions of 2P fractions amongst GCs.</td>

We present the\nstellar number density distributions in the R R Z plane, and the scale heights\nand scale lengths of the individual MAPs by fitting their vertical and radial\ndensity profiles. The vertical profiles, the variation trend of scale height\nwith the Galactocentric radius, indicate that there is a clear disk flare in\nthe outer disk both for the low-[{\alpha}/Fe] and the high-[{\alpha}/Fe] MAPs.\nWhile the radial surface density profiles show a peak radius of 7 kpc and 8 kpc\nfor the high-[{\alpha}/Fe] and low-[{\alpha}/Fe] MAPs, respectively. We also\ninvestigate the correlation between the mean rotation velocity and metallicity\nof the individual MAPs, and find that the mean rotation velocities are well\nseparated and show different trends between the high-[{\alpha}/Fe] and the\nlow-[{\alpha}/Fe] MAPs. At last, we discuss the character of the\nhigh-[{\alpha}/Fe] & high-[Fe/H] MAP and find that it is more similar to the\nhigh-[{\alpha}/Fe] MAP either in the radial and vertical density profiles or in\nthe rotation velocity.</td>

      <td>The Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) located in the inner regions of the\nMilky Way suffer from high extinction that makes their observation challenging.\nThe VVV survey provides a way to explore these GGCs in the near-infrared where\nextinction effects are highly diminished. We conduct a search for variable\nstars in several inner GGCs, taking advantage of the unique multi-epoch,\nwide-field, near-infrared photometry provided by the VVV survey. We are\nespecially interested in detecting classical pulsators that will help us\nconstrain the physical parameters of these GGCs. In this paper, the second of a\nseries, we focus on NGC6656 (M22), NGC6626 (M28), NGC6569, and NGC6441; these\nfour massive GGCs have known variable sources, but quite different\nmetallicities. We also revisit 2MASS-GC02 and Terzan10, the two GGCs studied in\nthe first paper of this series. We present an improved method and a new\nparameter that efficiently identify variable candidates in the GGCs. We also\nuse the proper motions of those detected variable candidates and their\npositions in the sky and in the color-magnitude diagrams to assign membership\nto the GGCs. We identify and parametrize in the near-infrared numerous variable\nsources in the studied GGCs, cataloging tens of previously undetected variable\nstars. We recover many known classical pulsators in these clusters, including\nthe vast majority of their fundamental mode RR Lyrae. We use these pulsators to\nobtain distances and extinctions toward these objects. Recalibrated\nperiod-luminosity-metallicity relations for the RR Lyrae bring the distances to\nthese GGCs to a closer agreement with those reported by Gaia, except for\nNGC6441. Recovered proper motions for these GGCs also agree with those reported\nby Gaia, except for 2MASS-GC02, the most reddened GGC in our sample, where the\nVVV near-infrared measurements provide a more accurate determination of its\nproper motions.</td>

Most\nof the detected stream is the trailing one, which stretches in the southern\nGalactic hemisphere and passes within a close distance of 3.2 kpc from the Sun,\ntherefore making the stream highly favorable for discovering relatively bright\nmember stars, while the leading arm is further from us and behind a disk\nforeground that is harder to separate from.

We obtain a best-fit model of the stream\nwhich is consistent with the measured proper motion, radial velocity and\ndistance to NGC 3201, and show it to be the same as the previously detected\nGj\"oll stream by Ibata et al.

      <td>Recent studies of warp kinematics using Gaia DR2 data have produced\ndetections of warp precession for the first time, which greatly exceeds\ntheoretical predictions of models. However, this detection assumes a warp model\nderived for a young population (few tens of megayears) to fit velocities of an\naverage older stellar population of the thin disk (several gigayears) in\nGaia-DR2 observations, which may lead to unaccounted systematic errors. Here,\nwe recalculate the warp precession with the same approach and Gaia DR2\nkinematic data, but using different warp parameters based on the fit of star\ncounts of the Gaia DR2 sample, which has a much lower warp amplitude than the\nyoung population. When we take into account this variation of the warp\namplitude with the age of the population, we find that there is no need for\nprecession. We find the value of warp precession $\beta = 4^{+6}_{-4}$ km\ns$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, which does not exclude nonprecessing warp.</td>

These\nelementsabundance constituted a multidimensional data space, and we introduced\nan algorithm method forprocessing multi-dimensional data to give the result of\ndimensionality reduction clustering. Accordingto chemical properties analysis,\nwe derived that some HVTD stars could origin from the thin disk,and some MRSH\nstars from dwarf galaxies, but those stars which have similar chemical\nabundancecharacteristics in both sample may form in-situ.</td>

      <td>G112-43/44, alias BD+00_2058 A and B, is a metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -1.3)\nwide-orbit binary star with extreme kinematics. We use high-precision\ndeterminations of the chemical compositions of 94 metal-poor dwarf stars in the\nsolar neighbourhood to compare abundance ratios for G112-43/44 with ratios for\nstars having similar metallicity taking into account the effect of deviations\nfrom local thermodynamic equilibrium on the derived abundances, and Gaia EDR3\ndata are used to compare the kinematics. The abundances of the two components\nof G112-43/44 agree within 0.05 dex for nearly all elements, but there is a\nhint of a correlation of the difference in [X/H] with elemental condensation\ntemperature, which may be due to planet-star interactions. The Mg/Fe, Si/Fe,\nCa/Fe, and Ti/Fe ratios of G112-43/44 agree with the corresponding ratios for\naccreted (Gaia-Enceladus) stars, but Mn/Fe, Ni/Fe, Cu/Fe, and Zn/Fe are\nsignificantly enhanced. The kinematics show that G112-43/44 belongs to the\nHelmi streams in the solar neighbourhood and in view of this, we discuss if the\nabundance peculiarities of G112-43/44 can be explained by chemical enrichment\nfrom supernovae events in the progenitor dwarf galaxy of the Helmi streams.\nInterestingly, yields calculated for a helium shell detonation Type Ia\nsupernova model can explain the enhancement of Mn/Fe, Ni/Fe, Cu/Fe, and Zn/Fe\nin G112-43/44 and three other alpha-poor stars in the Galactic halo, one of\nwhich have Helmi streams kinematics. The helium shell detonation model\npredicts, however, also enhanced abundance ratios of Ca/Fe, Ti/Fe, and Cr/Fe in\ndisagreement with the observed ratios.</td>

      <td>A search for distant, pulsating red giants in the southern halo</td>
      <td>To investigate the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) population in the Galactic\nhalo, we search for pulsating AGB stars at a heliocentric distance over 50kpc.\nOur research is based on the Catalina Southern Survey (CSS) catalogue of\nvariables, comprising 1286 long-period variables (LPVs) with declination less\nthan -20deg. We first focus on the 77 stars in the cap abs(b)>30deg for which\nspectral M-type or C-type classification can be derived from Hamburg-ESO\nobjective prism spectra. Most of these are oxygen-rich (M-type) and very few\nare carbon rich. The periods are in the range 100-500 days, and CSS amplitudes\nare up to 3 mag. In this small sample, no halo AGB star is fainter than\nKs0=12.5. This may be due to the scarcity of AGBs in the outer halo, or\ninsufficient instrumental depth. Leaving aside spectral information, we then\nsearched for even fainter pulsators (Ks>12.5) in the entire CSS catalogue. Gaia\nastrometry makes it possible to identify some contaminants. Our final result is\nthe identification of ten candidate distant LPVs. If these ten stars obey the\nfundamental mode K-band period luminosity relation used for Miras and\nsmall-amplitude Miras, their distances are between 50 and 120kpc from the Sun.\nIn a diagram showing distance versus Gaia tangential velocity, these ten stars\nhave positions similar to those of other objects in the halo, such as globular\nclusters and dwarf galaxies. We also detect some underluminous AGBs that\ndeserve further study. A detailed catalogue of the 77 high-latitude M or C\nstars will be made available at the CDS.</td>

      <td>We revisit large spectroscopic data sets for field stars from the literature\nto derive the upper Li envelope in the high metallicity regime in our Galaxy.\nWe take advantage of Gaia EDR3 data and state-of-the-art stellar models to\nprecisely determine the position of the sample dwarf stars in the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. The highest Li abundances are found in field\nmetal-rich warm dwarfs from the GALAH survey, located on the hot side of the\nLi-dip. Their mean Li value agrees with what was recently derived for warm\ndwarfs in metal-rich clusters, pointing towards a continuous increase of Li up\nto super-solar metallicity. However, if only cool dwarfs are considered in\nGALAH, as done in the other literature surveys, it is found that the upper Li\nenvelope decreases at super-solar metallicities, blurring the actual Li\nevolution picture. We confirm the suggestion that field and open cluster\nsurveys that found opposite Li behaviour in the high metallicity regime do not\nsample the same types of stars: The first ones, with the exception of GALAH,\nmiss warm dwarfs that can potentially preserve their original Li content.\nAlthough we can discard the bending of the Li upper envelope at high\nmetallicity derived from the analysis of cool star samples, we still need to\nevaluate the effects of atomic diffusion on warm, metal-rich early-F and late-A\ntype dwarfs before deriving the actual Li abundance at high metallicity.</td>

We explore the disturbances of\nthe current disc, the spatial and kinematical distributions of early accreted\nversus in-situ stars, the structures in the outer parts of the disc, and the\norbits of open clusters Berkeley 29 and Saurer 1. We find that: i) the dynamics\nof the Galactic disc are very complex with vertical asymmetries, and new\ncorrelations, including a bimodality with disc stars with large angular\nmomentum moving vertically upwards from below the plane, and disc stars with\nslightly lower angular momentum moving preferentially downwards; ii) we resolve\nthe kinematic substructure (diagonal ridges) in the outer parts of the disc for\nthe first time; iii) the red sequence that has been associated with the\nproto-Galactic disc that was present at the time of the merger with\nGaia-Enceladus-Sausage is currently radially concentrated up to around 14 kpc,\nwhile the blue sequence that has been associated with debris of the satellite\nextends beyond that; iv) there are density structures in the outer disc, both\nabove and below the plane, most probably related to Monoceros, the Anticentre\nStream, and TriAnd, for which the Gaia data allow an exhaustive selection of\ncandidate member stars and dynamical study; and v) the open clusters\nBerkeley~29 and Saurer~1, despite being located at large distances from the\nGalactic centre, are on nearly circular disc-like orbits. We demonstrate how,\nonce again, the Gaia are crucial for our understanding of the different pieces\nof our Galaxy and their connection to its global structure and history.</td>

      <td>The GALAH Survey: No chemical evidence of an extragalactic origin for the Nyx stream</td>
      <td>The results from the ESA Gaia astrometric mission and deep photometric\nsurveys have revolutionized our knowledge of the Milky Way. There are many\nongoing efforts to search these data for stellar substructure to find evidence\nof individual accretion events that built up the Milky Way and its halo. One of\nthese newly identified features, called Nyx, was announced as an accreted\nstellar stream traveling in the plane of the disk. Using a combination of\nelemental abundances and stellar parameters from the GALAH and APOGEE surveys,\nwe find that the abundances of the highest likelihood Nyx members are entirely\nconsistent with membership of the thick disk, and inconsistent with a dwarf\ngalaxy origin. We conclude that the postulated Nyx stream is most probably a\nhigh-velocity component of the Milky Way's thick disk. With the growing\navailability of large data sets including kinematics, stellar parameters, and\ndetailed abundances, the probability of detecting chance associations\nincreases, and hence new searches for substructure require confirmation across\nas many data dimensions as possible.</td>

Ranking these candidates based on the\nlikelihood that they are true GCs, we find that approximately 1900 belong to\nour top two ranking categories and should be the highest priority for\nspectroscopic follow-up for confirmation. Taking into account our new data and\na vetting of previous GC catalogs, we estimate a total GC population of $1450\n\pm 160$ GCs. We show that a substantial number of sources previously argued to\nbe low-velocity GCs are instead foreground stars, reducing the inferred GC\nvelocity dispersion. This work showcases the power of Gaia to identify slightly\nextended sources at the $\sim 4$ Mpc distance of NGC 5128, enabling accurate\nidentification of GCs throughout the entire extended halo, not just the inner\nregions that have been the focus of most previous work.</td>

      <td>The dominant site of production of $r$-process elements remains unclear\ndespite recent observations of a neutron star merger.

The recent Gaia data releases and large\nsamples from high-resolution optical spectroscopic surveys are enabling us to\ncompare $r$-process element abundances between stars formed in an accreted\ndwarf galaxy, Gaia-Enceladus, and those formed in the Milky Way. We aim to\nunderstand the origin of $r$-process elements in Gaia-Enceladus. We first\nconstruct a sample of stars to study Eu abundances without being affected by\nthe detection limit. We then kinematically select 71 Gaia-Enceladus stars and\n93 in-situ stars from the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) DR3, of\nwhich 50 and 75 stars can be used to study Eu reliably. Gaia-Enceladus stars\nclearly show higher ratios of [{Eu}/{Mg}] than in-situ stars. High [{Eu}/{Mg}]\nalong with low [{Mg}/{Fe}] are also seen in relatively massive satellite\ngalaxies such as the LMC, Fornax, and Sagittarius dwarfs. On the other hand,\nunlike these galaxies, Gaia-Enceladus does not show enhanced [{Ba}/{Eu}] or\n[{La}/{Eu}] ratios suggesting a lack of significant $s$-process contribution.\nFrom comparisons with simple chemical evolution models, we show that the high\n[{Eu}/{Mg}] of Gaia-Enceladus can naturally be explained by considering\n$r$-process enrichment by neutron-star mergers with delay time distribution\nthat follows a similar power-law as type~Ia supernovae but with a shorter\nminimum delay time.</td>

      <td>Evidence For Multiple Accretion Events in the $Gaia$-Sausage/Enceladus Structures</td>
      <td>We present evidence that multiple accretion events are required to explain\nthe origin of the $Gaia$-Sausage and Enceladus (GSE) structures, based on an\nanalysis of dynamical properties of main-sequence stars from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey Data Release 12 and $Gaia$ Data Release 2. GSE members are selected\nto have eccentricity ($e$) $>$ 0.7 and [Fe/H] $<$ -1.0, and separated into low\nand high orbital-inclination (LOI/HOI) groups. We find that the LOI stars\nmainly have $e < 0.9$ and are clearly separable into two groups with prograde\nand retrograde motions. The LOI stars exhibit prograde motions in the\ninner-halo region and strong retrograde motions in the outer-halo region. We\ninterpret the LOI stars in these regions to be stars accreted from two massive\ndwarf galaxies with low-inclination prograde and retrograde orbits, affected to\ndifferent extents by dynamical friction due to their different orbital\ndirections. In contrast, the majority of the HOI stars have $e > 0.9$, and\nexhibit a globally symmetric distribution of rotational velocities ($V_{\rm\n\phi}$) near zero, although there is evidence for a small retrograde motion for\nthese stars ($V_{\rm \phi}$ $\sim$ -15 $\rm{km~s^{-1}}$) in the outer-halo\nregion. We consider these stars to be stripped from a massive dwarf galaxy on a\nhigh-inclination orbit. We also find that the LOI and HOI stars on highly\neccentric and tangential orbits with clear retrograde motions exhibit different\nmetallicity peaks at [Fe/H] = -1.7 and -1.9, respectively, and argue that they\nare associated with two low-mass dwarf galaxies accreted in the outer-halo\nregion of the Galaxy.</td>

      <td>The distribution of open clusters in the Galaxy</td>
      <td>In this work we explore the new catalog of galactic open clusters that became\navailable recently, containing 1750 clusters that have been re-analysed using\nthe Gaia DR2 catalog to determine the stellar memberships. We used the young\nopen clusters as tracers of spiral arms and determined the spiral pattern\nrotation speed of the Galaxy and the corotation radius, the strongest Galactic\nresonance. The sample of open clusters used here increases the last one from\nDias et al. (2019) used in the previous determination of the pattern speed by\ndozens objects. In addition, the distances and ages values are better\ndetermined, using improvements to isochrone fitting and including an updated\nextinction polynomial for the Gaia DR2 photometric band-passes, and the\nGalactic abundance gradient as a prior for metallicity. In addition to the\nbetter age determinations, the catalog contains better positions in the\nGalactic plane and better proper motions. This allow us to discuss not only the\npresent space distribution of the clusters, but also the space distribution of\nthe clusters's birthplaces, obtained by integration of the orbits for a time\nequal to their age. The value of the rotation velocity of the arms ($28.5 \pm\n1.0$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$) implies that the corotation radius ($R_c$) is\nclose to the solar Galactic orbit ($R_c/R_0 = 1.01\pm0.08$), which is supported\nby other observational evidence discussed in this text. A simulation is\npresented, illustrating the motion of the clusters in the reference frame of\ncorotation. We also present general statistics of the catalog of clusters, like\nspatial distribution, distribution relative to height from the Galactic plane,\nand distribution of ages and metallicity. An important feature of the space\ndistribution, the corotation gap in the gas distribution and its consequences\nfor the young clusters, is discussed.</td>

      <td>We use $Gaia$ eDR3 data and legacy spectroscopic surveys to map the Milky Way\ndisc substructure towards the Galactic Anticenter at heliocentric distances\n$d\geq10\,\rm{kpc}$. We report the discovery of multiple previously undetected\nnew filaments embedded in the outer disc in highly extincted regions. Stars in\nthese over-densities have distance gradients expected for disc material and\nmove on disc-like orbits with $v_{\phi}\sim170-230\,\rm{km\,s^{-1}}$, showing\nsmall spreads in energy. Such a morphology argues against a quiescently growing\nGalactic thin disc. Some of these structures are interpreted as excited outer\ndisc material, kicked up by satellite impacts and currently undergoing\nphase-mixing ("feathers"). Due to the long timescale in the outer disc regions,\nthese structures can stay coherent in configuration space over several Gyrs. We\nnevertheless note that some of these structures could also be folds in the\nperturbed disc seen in projection from the Sun's location. A full 6D\nphase-space characterization and age dating of these structure should help\ndistinguish between the two possible morphologies.</td>

      <td>The influence of metallicity on the Leavitt Law from geometrical distances of Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds Cepheids</td>
      <td>The Cepheid Period-Luminosity (PL) relation is the key tool for measuring\nastronomical distances and for establishing the extragalactic distance scale.\nIn particular, the local value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) strongly depends\non Cepheid distance measurements. The recent Gaia Data Releases and other\nparallax measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) already enabled to\nimprove the accuracy of the slope ($\alpha$) and intercept ($\beta$) of the PL\nrelation. However, the dependence of this law on metallicity is still largely\ndebated. In this paper, we combine three samples of Cepheids in the Milky Way\n(MW), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) in\norder to derive the metallicity term (hereafter $\gamma$) of the PL relation.\nThe recent publication of extremely precise LMC and SMC distances based on\nlate-type detached eclipsing binary systems (DEBs) provides a solid anchor for\nthe Magellanic Clouds. In the MW, we adopt Cepheid parallaxes from the early\nthird Gaia Data Release. We derive the metallicity effect in $V$, $I$, $J$,\n$H$, $K_S$, $W_{VI}$ and $W_{JK}$. In the $K_S$ band we report a metallicity\neffect of $-0.221 \pm 0.051$ mag/dex, the negative sign meaning that more\nmetal-rich Cepheids are intrinsically brighter than their more metal-poor\ncounterparts of the same pulsation period.</td>

We complement this data with the Astrometry Spread Function (ASF),\nthe expected uncertainty in the measured positions, proper motions and parallax\nfor a non-accelerating point source. The ASF is a Gaussian function for which\nwe construct the 5D astrometric covariance matrix as a function of position on\nthe sky and apparent magnitude using the Gaia DR2 scanning law and demonstrate\nexcellent agreement with the observed data. This can be used to answer the\nquestion `What astrometric covariance would Gaia have published if my star was\na non-accelerating point source?'.\n  The ASF will enable characterisation of binary systems, exoplanet orbits,\nastrometric microlensing events and extended sources which add an excess\nastrometric noise to the expected astrometry uncertainty. By using the ASF to\nestimate the unit weight error (UWE) of Gaia DR2 sources, we demonstrate that\nthe ASF indeed provides a direct probe of the excess source noise.\n  We use the ASF to estimate the contribution to the selection function of the\nGaia astrometric sample from a cut on astrometric_sigma5d_max showing high\ncompleteness for $G<20$ dropping to $<1\%$ in underscanned regions of the sky\nfor $G=21$.\n  We have added an ASF module to the Python package SCANNINGLAW\n(https://github.com/gaiaverse/scanninglaw) through which users can access the\nASF.</td>

Methods. We investigated all\nVVVX-enabled discoveries of GC candidates in a region covering about 180 sq.\ndeg. toward the bulge and the Sgr dwarf galaxy. We used multiband point-spread\nfunction photometry to obtain deep color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and\nluminosity functions (LFs) for all GC candidates, complemented by accurate\nGaia-EDR3 proper motions (PMs) to select Sgr members and variability\ninformation to select RR Lyrae which are potential GC members. Results. After\napplying a strict PM cut to discard foreground bulge and disk stars, the CMDs\nand LFs for some of the GC candidates exhibit well defined red giant branches\nand red clump giant star peaks. We selected the best Sgr GCs, estimating their\ndistances, reddenings, and associated RR Lyrae. Conclusions. We discover 12 new\nSgr GC members, more than doubling the number of GCs known in this dwarf\ngalaxy.

      <td>Determination of the escape velocity of the Milky Way using a proper motion selected halo sample</td>
      <td>The {\it Gaia} mission has provided the largest catalogue ever of sources\nwith tangential velocity information. However, using this catalogue for\ndynamical studies is difficult because most of the stars lack line-of-sight\nvelocity measurements. Recently, we presented a selection of $\sim 10^7$ halo\nstars with accurate distances that have been selected based on their photometry\nand proper motions. Using this sample, we model the tail of the velocity\ndistribution with a power-law distribution, a commonly used approach first\nestablished by \cite{Leonard1990THESPEED}. For the first time ever we use\ntangential velocities measured accurately for an unprecedented number of halo\nstars to estimate the escape velocity. In the solar neighbourhood, we obtain a\nvery precise estimate of the escape velocity which is $497^{+8}_{-8}~{\rm\nkm/s}$. This estimate is most likely biased low, our best guess is by 10\%. As\na result, the true escape velocity most likely is closer to $550~{\rm km/s}$.\nThe escape velocity directly constrains the total mass of the Milky Way. To\nfind the best fitting halo mass and concentration parameter we adjusted the\ndark (spherical NFW) halo of a realistic Milky Way potential while keeping the\ncircular velocity at the solar radius fixed at $v_c(R_\odot) = 232.8~{\rm\nkm/s}$. The resulting halo parameters are $M_{200}^{+10\%} =\n1.11^{+0.08}_{-0.07} \cdot10^{12} ~{\rm M}_\odot$ and concentration parameter\n$c^{+10\%} = 11.8^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$, where we use the explicit notation to\nindicate that these have been corrected for the 10\% bias. The slope of the\nescape velocity with galactocentric distance is as expected in the inner Galaxy\nbased on Milky Way models. Curiously, we find a disagreement beyond the solar\nradius which is likely an effect of a change in the shape of the velocity\ndistribution and could be related to the presence of velocity clumps.</td>

The blue extention of the horizontal\nbranch (HBX) includes BHB tail stars and Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB) stars.\nWe present a method for identifying HBX stars in the field, using spectra and\nphotometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 (SDSS DR14). We\nderive an estimate for the absolute magnitudes of BHB tail and EHB stars as a\nfunction of color, and use this relationship to calculate distances. We\nidentify an overdensity of HBX stars that appears to trace the northern end of\nthe Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC). We identify three stars that are likely part\nof a tidal stream, but this is not enough stars to explain the observed\noverdensity. Combining SDSS data with Gaia DR2 proper motions allows us to show\nthat the orbits of the majority of the HBX stars in the overdensity are on high\neccentricity orbits similar to those in the Virgo Radial\nMerger/Gaia-Enceladus/Gaia Sausage structure, and that the overdensity of high\neccentricity orbits extends all the way to the Virgo Overdensity. We use\nstellar kinematics to separate the HBX stars into disk stars andhalo stars. The\nhalo stars are primarily on highly eccentric (radial) orbits. The fraction of\nHBX stars that are EHBs is highest in the disk population and lowest in the low\neccentricity halo stars.</td>

We carefully construct a training set to\nminimise bias and apply BINGO to a stellar population that is similar to our\ntraining set. We then select the 17,305 stars with ages from BINGO and reliable\nkinematic properties obtained from \textit{Gaia} DR2. By combining the age and\nchemo-kinematical information, we dissect the Galactic disc stars into three\ncomponents, namely, the thick disc (old, high-[$\alpha$/Fe], [$\alpha$/Fe]\n$\gtrsim$ 0.12), the thin disc (young, low-[$\alpha$/Fe]) and the Bridge, which\nis a region between the thick and thin discs. Our results indicate that the\nthick disc formed at an early epoch only in the inner region, and the inner\ndisc smoothly transforms to the thin disc. We found that the outer disc follows\na different chemical evolution pathway from the inner disc. The outer\nmetal-poor stars only start forming after the compact thick disc phase has\ncompleted and the star-forming gas disc extended outwardly with metal-poor gas\naccretion. We found that in the Bridge region the range of [Fe/H] becomes wider\nwith decreasing age, which suggests that the Bridge region corresponds to the\ntransition phase from the smaller chemically well-mixed thick to a larger thin\ndisc with a metallicity gradient.</td>

Our goal is to confirm the physical\nnature of two GC candidates: Patchick99 and TBJ3, located towards the Galactic\nbulge. We use public data in the near-IR from the VVV, VVVX and 2MASS along the\nwith deep optical data from the Gaia DR2, in order to estimate their main\nphysical parameters: reddening, extinction, distance, luminosity, mean cluster\nproper motions (PMs), size, metallicity and age. We investigate both candidates\nat different wavelengths. We use near-IR and optical CMDs in order to analyse\nPatchick99. We decontaminate CMDs following a statistical procedure and\nPM-selection. Reddening and extinction are derived by adopting reddening maps.\nMetallicity and age are evaluated by fitting stellar isochrones. Reddening and\nextinction are E(J-Ks)=0.12+/-0.02 mag, AKs=0.09+/-0.01 mag from the VVV data,\nwhereas E(BP-RP)=0.21+/-0.03 mag, AG=0.68+/-0.08 mag from Gaia DR2. We estimate\na distance d=6.4+/-0.2 kpc in near-IR and D=7.0+/-0.2 kpc in optical. We derive\nits metallicity and age fitting PARSEC isochrones, finding [Fe/H]=-0.2+/-0.2\ndex and t=10+/-2 Gyr. The mean PMs for Patchick99 are pmRA=-298+/-1.74 mas/yr\nand pmDEC=-5.49+/-2.02 mas/yr. We confirm that it is a low-luminosity GC, with\nMKs=-7.0+/-0.6 mag. The radius estimation is performed building the radial\ndensity profile, finding r~10'. We recognise 7 RR Lyrae star members within 8.2\narcmin from its centre, confirming the distance found by other methods. We\nfound that TBJ3 shows mid-IR emissions that are not present in GCs. We discard\nTBJ3 as GC candidate and we focus on Patchick99. We conclude that it is an old\nmetal-rich GC, situated in the Galactic bulge.</td>

      <td>CONTEXT. Gaia EDR3 has produced parallaxes for 1.468x10^9 sources but there\nare calibration issues that require corrections to the published values and\nuncertainties. AIMS. We want to characterize the behavior of the uncertainties\nof the Gaia EDR3 parallaxes. We also aim to provide a procedure for the\ncalculation of distances to stars and stellar clusters. METHODS. We reanalyze\nsome of the data in the calibration papers for QSO and LMC parallaxes and\ncombine those results with measurements for six bright GCs. We calculate the\nangular covariance of EDR3 parallaxes at small separations based on the LMC\nresults and combine it with the results for larger angles using QSOs to obtain\nan analytical formula for the angular covariance over the whole sky. The\nresults for the six GCs are used to validate the parallax bias correction as a\nfunction of magnitude, color, and ecliptic latitude and to determine the\nconstant used to convert internal uncertainties to external ones. RESULTS. The\nangular covariance at zero separation is 106.2 muas^2, yielding a minimum\nuncertainty for EDR3 parallaxes of 10.3 muas for individual stars. That value\ncan be only slightly reduced for GCs after considering the behavior of the\nangular covariance of the parallaxes for small separations. The Lindegren et\nal. parallax bias correction works quite well, except for the brighter\nmagnitudes, suggesting improvements may be possible there. The value of k is\n1.1-1.7 and depends on G. Stars with moderately large values of RUWE can still\nprovide useful parallaxes albeit with larger values of k. We give accurate and\nprecise Gaia EDR3 distances to the six GCs and for the specific case of 47 Tuc\nwe are able to beat the angular covariance limit and derive a high-precision\ndistance of 4.53+-0.06 kpc. Finally, a recipe for the derivation of distances\nto stars and stellar clusters using Gaia EDR3 parallaxes is given. [ABRIDGED]</td>

      <td>Analysis of galaxy kinematics based on Cepheids from the Gaia DR2 Catalogue</td>
      <td>To construct the rotation curve of the Galaxy, classical Cepheids with proper\nmotions, parallaxes and line-of-sight velocities from the Gaia DR2 Catalog are\nused in large part. The working sample formed from literature data contains\nabout 800 Cepheids with estimates of their age. We determined that the linear\nrotation velocity of the Galaxy at a solar distance is $V_0=240\pm3$~km\ns$^{-1}$. In this case, the distance from the Sun to the axis of rotation of\nthe Galaxy is found to be $R_0=8.27\pm0.10$~kpc. A spectral analysis of radial\nand residual tangential velocities of Cepheids younger than 120 Myr showed\nclose estimates of the parameters of the spiral density wave obtained from data\nboth at present time and in the past. So, the value of the wavelength\n$\lambda_{R,\theta}$ is in the range of [2.4--3.0] kpc, the pitch angle\n$i_{R,\theta}$ is in the range of [$-13^\circ$,$-10^\circ$] for a four-arm\npattern model, the amplitudes of the radial and tangential perturbations are\n$f_R\sim12$~km s$^{-1}$ and $f_\theta\sim9$~km s$^{-1}$, respectively.\nVelocities of Cepheids older than 120 Myr are currently giving a wavelength\n$\lambda_{R,\theta}\sim5$~kpc. This value differs significantly from one that\nwe obtained from the samples of young Cepheids. An analysis of positions and\nvelocities of old Cepheids, calculated by integrating their orbits backward in\ntime, made it possible to determine significantly more reliable values of the\nparameters of the spiral density wave: wavelength $\lambda_{R,\theta}=2.7$~kpc,\namplitudes of radial and tangential perturbations are $f_R=7.9$~km s$^{-1}$ and\n$f_\theta=5$~km s$^{-1}$, respectively.</td>

The combination\nof Gaia DR2 radial velocities with the more precise and accurate astrometry\nprovided by Gaia EDR3 makes the best dataset available to search for the\nfastest nearby stars in our Galaxy. We compute the velocity distribution of ~7\nmillion stars with precise parallaxes, to investigate the high-velocity tail of\nthe velocity distribution of stars in the Milky Way. We release a catalogue\nwith distances, total velocities, and corresponding uncertainties for all the\nstars considered in our analysis, available at\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/tmarchetti/research . By applying quality cuts on\nthe Gaia astrometry and radial velocities, we identify a clean subset of 94\nstars with a probability Pub > 50% to be unbound from our Galaxy. 17 of these\nhave Pub > 80% and are our best candidates. We propagate these stars in the\nGalactic potential to characterize their orbits. We find that 11 stars are\nconsistent with being ejected from the Galactic disk, and are possible\nhyper-runaway star candidates. The other 6 stars are not consistent with coming\nfrom a known star-forming region. We investigate the effect of adopting a\nparallax zero point correction, which strongly impacts our results: when\napplying this correction, we identify only 12 stars with Pub > 50%, 3 of these\nhaving Pub > 80%. Spectroscopic follow-ups with ground-based telescopes are\nneeded to confirm the candidates identified in this work.</td>

Due to extreme foreground extinction we\npossess only sparse information about the (mostly old) stellar population of\nthe nuclear disc. Here we present our KMOS spectroscopic survey of the stars in\nthe nuclear disk reaching the old populations. In order to obtain an unbiased\ndata set, we sample stars in the full extinction range along each\nline-of-sight. We also observe reference fields in neighboring regions of the\nGalactic bulge. Here we describe the design and execution of the survey and\npresent first results. We obtain spectra and five spectral indices of 3113\nstars with a median S/N of 67 and measure radial velocities for 3051 stars. Of\nthose, 2735 sources have sufficient S/N to estimate temperatures and\nmetallicities from indices. We derive metallicities using the CO 2-0 and Na I\nK-band spectral features, where we derive our own empirical calibration using\nmetallicities obtained with higher resolution observations. We use 183 giant\nstars for calibration spanning in metallicity from -2.5 to 0.6 dex and covering\ntemperatures of up to 5500 K. The derived index based metallicities deviate\nfrom the calibration values with a scatter of 0.32 dex. The internal\nuncertainty of our metallicities is likely smaller. We use these metallicity\nmeasurements together with the CO index to derive effective temperatures using\nliterature relations. We publish the catalog here. Our data set complements\nGalactic surveys such as Gaia and APOGEE for the inner 200 pc radius of the\nMilky Way which is not readily accessible by those surveys due to extinction.\nWe will use the derived properties in future papers for further analysis of the\nnuclear disk.</td>

      <td>We present an updated version of the semi-analytic Just-Jahrei{\ss} (JJ)\nmodel of the Galactic disk and constrain its parameters in the Solar\nneighbourhood. The new features of the JJ model include a simple two-component\ngaseous disk, a star-formation rate (SFR) function of the thick disk that has\nbeen extended in time, and a correlation between the kinematics of molecular\ngas and thin-disk populations. Here, we study the vertical number density\nprofiles and W-velocity distributions determined from ~2 million local stars of\nthe Gaia DR2. We also investigate an apparent Hess diagram of the Gaia stars\nselected in a conic volume towards the Galactic poles. Using a stellar\nevolution library, we synthesise stellar populations with a four-slope broken\npower-law initial mass function (IMF), the SFR, and an age-metallicity relation\n(AMR). The latter is consistently derived with the observed metallicity\ndistribution of the local Red Clump (RC) giants from the APOGEE. Working within\na Bayesian approach, we sample the posterior probability distribution in a\nmultidimensional parameter space using the MCMC method. We find that the\nspatial distribution and motion of the Gaia stars imply two recent SF bursts\ncentered at ages of ~0.5 Gyr and ~3 Gyr and characterised by a ~30% and ~55% SF\nenhancement, respectively, relative to a monotonously declining SFR continuum.\nThe stellar populations associated with this SF excess are found to be\ndynamically hot for their age: they have W-velocity dispersions of ~12.5 km/s\nand ~26 km/s. The new JJ model is able to reproduce the local star counts with\nan accuracy of ~5 %. Using Gaia DR2 data, we self-consistently constrained 22\nparameters of the updated JJ model. Our optimised model predicts two SF bursts\nwithin the last ~4 Gyr, which may point to recent episodes of gas infall.</td>

We find a clear misalignment between the stream track\nand the direction of the reflex-corrected proper motions in the leading arm of\nthe stream, which we interpret as a signature of a time-dependent perturbation\nof the gravitational potential. A likely cause of this perturbation is the\nrecent passage of the most massive Milky Way satellite - the Large Magellanic\nCloud (LMC). We develop novel methods for simulating the Sagittarius stream in\nthe presence of the LMC, using specially tailored N-body simulations and a\nflexible parametrization of the Milky Way halo density profile. We find that\nwhile models without the LMC can fit most stream features rather well, they\nfail to reproduce the misalignment and overestimate the distance to the leading\narm apocentre. On the other hand, models with an LMC mass in the range\n(1.3+-0.3)x10^11 Msun rectify these deficiencies. We demonstrate that the\nstream can not be modelled adequately in a static Milky Way. Instead, our\nGalaxy is required to lurch toward the massive in-falling Cloud, giving the Sgr\nstream its peculiar shape and kinematics. By exploring the parameter space of\nMilky Way potentials, we determine the enclosed mass within 100 kpc to be\n(5.6+-0.4)x10^11 Msun, and the virial mass to be (9.0+-1.3)x10^11 Msun, and\nfind tentative evidence for a radially-varying shape and orientation of the\nGalactic halo.</td>

      <td>Mapping Luminous Hot Stars in the Galaxy</td>
      <td>[Abridged] Luminous hot stars dominate the stellar energy input to the\ninterstellar medium throughout cosmological time, they are laboratories to test\ntheories of stellar evolution and multiplicity, and they serve as luminous\ntracers of star formation in the Milky Way and other galaxies. Massive stars\noccupy well-defined loci in colour-colour and colour-magnitude spaces, enabling\nselection based on the combination of Gaia EDR3 astrometry and photometry and\n2MASS photometry, even in the presence of substantive dust extinction. In this\npaper we devise an all-sky sample of such luminous OBA-type stars, designed to\nbe quite complete rather than very pure, to serve as targets for spectroscopic\nfollow-up with the SDSS-V survey. We estimate "astro-kinematic" distances by\ncombining parallaxes and proper motions with a model for the expected velocity\nand density distribution of young stars; we show that this adds useful\nconstraints on the stars' distances, and hence luminosities. With these\ndistances we map the spatial distribution of a more stringently selected\nsub-sample across the Galactic disc, and find it to be highly structured, with\ndistinct over- and under-densities. The most evident over-densities can be\nassociated with the presumed spiral arms of the Milky Way, in particular the\nSagittarius-Carina and Scutum-Centaurus arms. Yet, the spatial picture of the\nMilky Way's young disc structure emerging in this study is complex, and\nsuggests that most young stars in our Galaxy ($t_{age}<t_{dyn}$) are not neatly\norganised into distinct spiral arms. The combination of the comprehensive\nspectroscopy to come from SDSS-V (yielding velocities, ages, etc..) with future\nGaia data releases will be crucial to reveal the dynamical nature of the spiral\narm themselves.</td>

Using machine-learning\ntechniques, we have combined the information provided by 3300 RR Lyrae stars,\nmore than 2000 spectroscopically observed stars, and the Gaia second data\nrelease to derive the full phase space, i.e. 3D positions and kinematics, of\nmore than $1.2\times10^5$ member stars in the core of the galaxy. Our results\nshow that Sgr has a bar structure $\sim 2.5$ kpc long, and that tidal tails\nemerge from its tips to form what it is known as the Sgr stream. The main body\nof the galaxy, strongly sheared by tidal forces, is a triaxial (almost prolate)\nellipsoid with its longest principal axis of inertia inclined\n$43^\circ\pm6^\circ$ with respect to the plane of the sky and axis ratios of\n1:0.67:0.60. Its external regions are expanding mainly along its longest\nprincipal axis, yet the galaxy conserves an inner core of about\n$500\times330\times300$ pc that shows no net expansion and is rotating at\n$v_{\rm rot} = 4.13 \pm 0.16$ ${\rm{ km \ s^{-1}}}$. The internal angular\nmomentum of Sgr forms an angle $\theta = 18^\circ\pm6^\circ$ with respect to\nits orbital angular momentum, meaning that the galaxy is in an inclined\nprograde orbit around the Milky Way. We compared our results with predictions\nfrom $N$-body models with spherical, pressure-supported progenitors and a model\nwhose progenitor is a flattened rotating disk. Only the rotating model, based\non preexisting simulations aimed at reproducing the line-of-sight velocity\ngradients observed in Sgr, was able to reproduce the observed properties in the\ncore of the galaxy.</td>

We leverage this information to\nstudy the chemical distribution throughout the Galactic disk of 21 elements,\nfrom C to Eu. The radial metallicity gradient obtained from our analysis is\n$-$0.076$\pm$0.009 dex kpc$^{-1}$, which is in agreement with previous works\nbased on smaller samples. Furthermore, the gradient in the [Fe/H] - guiding\nradius (r$_{\rm guid}$) plane is $-$0.073$\pm$0.008 dex kpc$^{-1}$. We show\nconsistently that open clusters trace the distribution of chemical elements\nthroughout the Galactic disk differently than field stars. In particular, at\ngiven radius, open clusters show an age-metallicity relation that has less\nscatter than field stars. As such scatter is often interpreted as an effect of\nradial migration, we suggest that these differences are due to the physical\nselection effect imposed by our Galaxy: clusters that would have migrated\nsignificantly also had higher chances to get destroyed. Finally, our results\nreveal trends in the [X/Fe]$-$r$_{\rm guid}$$-$age space, which are important\nto understand production rates of different elements as a function of space and\ntime.</td>

For this,\nwe use the new MAMPOSSt-PM Bayesian mass-modeling code, along with updated\nestimates of the surface density profile of NGC 6397. We consider different\npriors on velocity anisotropy and on the size of the central mass, and we also\nseparate the stars into components of different mean mass to allow for mass\nsegregation. The velocity ellipsoid is very isotropic throughout the cluster,\nas expected in post-core collapsed clusters subject to as strong a Galactic\ntidal field as NGC 6397. There is strong evidence for a central dark component\nof 0.8 to 2% of the total mass of the cluster. However, we find robust evidence\ndisfavoring a central IMBH in NGC 6397, preferring instead a diffuse dark inner\nsubcluster of unresolved objects with a total mass of 1000 to 2000 solar\nmasses, half of which is concentrated within 6 arcsec (2% of the stellar\neffective radius). These results require the combination of HST and Gaia data:\nHST for the inner diagnostics and Gaia for the outer surface density and\nvelocity anisotropy profiles. The small effective radius of the diffuse dark\ncomponent suggests that it is composed of compact stars (white dwarfs and\nneutron stars) and stellar-mass black holes, whose inner locations are caused\nby dynamical friction given their high progenitor masses. We show that\nstellar-mass black holes should dominate the mass of this diffuse dark\ncomponent, unless more than 25 per cent escape from the cluster. Their mergers\nin the cores of core-collapsed globular clusters could be an important source\nof the gravitational wave events detected by LIGO.</td>

We also show the near-infrared CMDs and spatial distributions\nfor the different VSX types of variable stars, including important distance\nindicators, such as RR Lyrae, Cepheids, and Miras. By analysing the photometric\nflags in our catalogue, we found that about 20% of the stars with measured and\nverified variability are flagged as non-stellar sources, even when they are\noutside of the saturation and/or noise regimes. Additionally, we pair-matched\nour sample with the VIVA catalogue and found that more than half of our sources\nare missing from the VVV variability list, mostly due to observations with low\nsignal-to-noise ratio or photometric problems with a low percentage due to\nfailures in the selection process.

Comparing positions of Gaia candidate\ncounterparts for XRBs in our sample to positions of spiral arms in the Milky\nWay, we find that HMXBs exhibit mild preference for being closer to spiral\narms; LMXBs exhibit mild preference for being closer to inter-arm regions.\nLMXBs do not exhibit any preference for leading or trailing their closest\nspiral arm. HMXBs exhibit a mild preference for trailing their closest spiral\narm. The lack of a strong correlation between HMXBs and spiral arms may be\nexplained by star formation occurring closer to the midpoint of the arms, or a\ntime delay between star formation and HMXB formation manifesting as a spatial\nseparation between HMXBs and the spiral arm where they formed.</td>

      <td>Co-formation of the thin and thick discs revealed by APOGEE-DR16 and Gaia-DR2</td>
      <td>Since thin disc stars are younger than thick disc stars on average, the thin\ndisc is predicted by some models to start forming after the thick disc had\nformed, around 10 Gyr ago. Accordingly, no significant old thin disc population\nshould exist. Using 6-D coordinates from Gaia-DR2 and age estimates from\nSanders & Das (2018), we select $\sim 24000$ old stars (${\tau > 10}$ Gyr, with\nuncertainties $\lesssim 15\%$) within 2 kpc from the Sun (full sample). A\ncross-match with APOGEE-DR16 ($\sim 1000$ stars) reveals comparable fractions\nof old chemically defined thin/thick disc stars. We show that the full sample\npericenter radius ($r_\mathrm{per}$) distribution has three peaks, one\nassociated with the stellar halo and the other two having contributions from\nthe thin/thick discs. Using a high-resolution $N$-body+Smooth Particle\nHydrodynamics simulation, we demonstrate that one peak, at\n$r_\mathrm{per}\approx 7.1$ kpc, is produced by stars from both discs which\nwere born in the inner Galaxy and migrated to the Solar Neighbourhood. In the\nSolar Neighbourhood, $\sim 1/2$ ($\sim 1/3$) of the old thin (thick) disc stars\nare classified as migrators. Our results suggest that thin/thick discs are\naffected differently by radial migration inasmuch as they have different\neccentricity distributions, regardless of vertical scale heights. We interpret\nthe existence of a significant old thin disc population as evidence for an\nearly co-formation of thin/thick discs, arguing that clump instabilities in the\nearly disc offer a compelling explanation for the observed trends.</td>

Within the virial radius\nof the Milky Way (224 kpc here), 53 of 55 dwarf galaxies are devoid of gas to\nlimits of M$_{\rm HI}<10^4$ M$_\odot$. Within the virial radius of M31 (266\nkpc), 27 of 30 dwarf galaxies are devoid of gas (with limits typically $<10^5$\nM$_\odot$). Beyond the virial radii of the Milky Way and M31, the majority of\nthe dwarf galaxies have detected HI gas and have HI masses higher than the\nlimits. When the relationship between gas content and distance is investigated\nusing a Local Group virial radius, more of the non-detected dwarf galaxies are\nwithin this radius (85$\pm1$ of the 93 non-detected dwarf galaxies) than within\nthe virial radii of the Milky Way and M31. Using the Gaia proper motion\nmeasurements available for 38 dwarf galaxies, the minimum gas density required\nto completely strip them of gas is calculated. Halo densities between $10^{-5}$\nand $5 \times 10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$ are typically required for instantaneous\nstripping at perigalacticon. When compared to halo density with radius\nexpectations from simulations and observations, 80% of the dwarf galaxies with\nproper motions are consistent with being stripped by ram pressure at Milky Way\npericenter. The results suggest a diffuse gaseous galactic halo medium is\nimportant in quenching dwarf galaxies, and that a Local Group medium also\npotentially plays a role.</td>

      <td>The COMBS Survey -- II. Distinguishing the Metal-Poor Bulge from the Halo Interlopers</td>
      <td>The metal-poor stars in the bulge are important relics of the Milky Way's\nformation history, as simulations predict that they are some of the oldest\nstars in the Galaxy. In order to determine if they are truly ancient stars, we\nmust understand the origins of this population. Currently, it is unclear if the\nmetal-poor stars in the bulge ([Fe/H] < -1 dex) are merely halo interlopers, a\nunique accreted population, part of the boxy/peanut-shaped (B/P) bulge or a\nclassical bulge population. In this work, we use spectra from the VLT/FLAMES\nspectrograph to obtain metallicity estimates using the Ca-II triplet (CaT) of\n473 bulge stars (187 of which have [Fe/H]<-1 dex), targeted using SkyMapper\nphotometry. We also use Gaia DR2 parallaxes and proper motions to infer the\nGalactic positions and velocities along with orbital properties for 523 bulge\nstars. We employ a probabilistic orbit analysis and find that about half of our\nsample has a > 50\% probability of being bound to the bulge, and half are halo\ninterlopers. We also see that the occurrence rate of halo interlopers increases\nsteadily with decreasing metallicity across the full range of our sample (-3 <\n[Fe/H] < 0.5). Our examination of the kinematics of the confined compared to\nthe unbound stars indicates the metal-poor bulge ([Fe/H] < -1 dex) comprises at\nleast two populations; those confined to the boxy/peanut bulge and halo stars\npassing through the inner galaxy. We conclude that an orbital analysis\napproach, as we have employed, is important to uncover and understand the\ncomposite nature of the metal-poor stars in the inner region.</td>

Based on a\ndetailed population synthesis model, we apply a method that relies on Gaia\nastrometry and photometry to accurately derive the individual white dwarf\nparameters (mass, radius, effective temperature, bolometric luminosity and\nage). This method is tested with 25 white dwarfs of our sample for which we\ntook optical spectra and performed spectroscopic analysis. We build and analyse\nthe halo white dwarf luminosity function, for which we find for the first time\npossible evidences of the cut-off at its faintest end, leading to an age\nestimate of $\simeq12\pm0.5 $Gyr. The mass distribution of the sample peaks at\n$0.589\,M_{\odot}$, with $71\%$ of the white dwarf masses below\n$0.6\,M_{\odot}$ and just two massive white dwarfs of more than\n$0.8\,M_{\odot}$. From the age distribution we find three white dwarfs with\ntotal ages above 12 Gyr, of which J1312-4728 is the oldest white dwarf known\nwith an age of $12.41\pm0.22 $Gyr. We prove that the star formation history is\nmainly characterised by a burst of star formation that occurred from 10 to 12\nGyr in the past, but extended up to 8 Gyr. We also find that the peak of the\nstar formation history is centered at around 11 Gyr, which is compatible with\nthe current age of the Gaia-Enceladus encounter. Finally, $13\%$ of our halo\nsample is contaminated by high-speed young objects (total age<7 Gyr). The\norigin of these white dwarfs is unclear but their age distribution may be\ncompatible with the encounter with the Sagittarius galaxy.</td>

Our results reveal abundant but\nclear stellar kinematic patterns and structures in the age -- metallicity and\nthe disc $R$ -- $Z$ plane. The most prominent feature is the strong variations\nof the velocity, action, and orbital parameter distributions from the young,\nmetal-rich thin disc to the old, metal-poor thick disc, a number of\nsmaller-scale structures -- such as velocity streams, north-south asymmetries,\nand kinematic features of spiral arms -- are clearly revealed. Particularly,\nthe skewness of $V_{\phi}$ and $J_{\phi}$ reveals a new substructure at\n$R\simeq12$\,kpc and $Z\simeq0$\,kpc, possibly related to dynamical effects of\nspiral arms in the outer disc. We further study the stellar migration through\nanalysing the stellar orbital parameters and stellar birth radii. The results\nsuggest that the thick disc stars near the solar radii and beyond are mostly\nmigrated from the inner disc of $R\sim4 - 6$\,kpc due to their highly\neccentrical orbits. Stellar migration due to dynamical processes with angular\nmomentum transfer (churning) are prominent for both the old, metal-rich stars\n(outward migrators) and the young metal-poor stars (inward migrators). The\nspatial distribution in the $R$ -- $Z$ plane for the inward migrators born at a\nGalactocentric radius of $>$12\,kpc show clear age stratifications, possibly an\nevidence that these inward migrators are consequences of splashes triggered by\nmerger events of satellite galaxies that have been lasted in the past few giga\nyears.</td>

Interestingly, only the EHB star and blue\nhorizontal branch stars (BHBs) among the UV-bright hot sources are detected in\nFUV filters of UVIT. We have derived the effective temperature of BHBs using\ncolor-temperature relation and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of\nmulti-band filters, which are in the range from 8,000 K to 10,500 K. We find a\nvariation of He abundance of BHBs by fitting the BaSTI ZAHB. The range in the\nHe abundance of the BHBs corresponding to the best fit isochrones is 0.247 to\n0.350. We have estimated various physical parameters of the newly identified\nEHB star in the cluster using SED fit and post-HB evolutionary tracks.

In doing this we use $3$ million galaxies to\nrecalibrate the astrometry and set up a common reference frame between the two\ncatalogues. The exquisite depth and the nearly $12$ years of time baseline\nbetween HSC and SDSS enable high-precision measurements of statistical proper\nmotions for stars down to $i\simeq 24$. A validation of our method is\ndemonstrated by the agreement with the $Gaia$ proper motions, to the precision\nbetter than $0.1$ mas yr$^{-1}$. To retain the precision, we make a correction\nof the subtle effects due to the differential chromatic refraction in the SDSS\nimages based on the comparison with the $Gaia$ proper motions against colour of\nstars, which is validated using the SDSS spectroscopic quasars. Combining with\nthe photometric distance estimates for individual stars based on the precise\nHSC photometry, we show a significant detection of the net proper motions for\nstars in each bin of distance out to $100$ kpc. The two-component tangential\nvelocities after subtracting the apparent motions due to our own motion display\nrich phase-space structures including a clear signature of the Sagittarius\nstream in the halo region of distance range $[10,\ 35]$ kpc. We also measure\nthe tangential velocity dispersion in the distance range $5-20$ kpc and find\nthat the data are consistent with a constant isotropic dispersion of $80\pm 10\\n{\rm km/s}$.

      <td>Abundances of beryllium in metal-poor stars scale linearly with metallicity\ndown to [Fe/H] ~ -3.0. In the stars where Be has been detected at this\nextremely metal-poor regime, an increased abundance scatter has been previously\nreported. This scatter could indicate a flattening of the relation between Be\nand [Fe/H]. Our aim is to perform a new investigation of Be abundances in\nextremely metal-poor stars and try to clarify whether a Be abundance plateau\nexists. We revisited the Be abundances in a sample of nine dwarfs with [Fe/H] ~\n-3.0. Additionally, we analysed the Be lines in the spectra of stars BPS BS\n16968-0061 and CD-33 1173 for the first time. We took advantage of Gaia DR2\nparallaxes to refine values of the surface gravity of the stars. Abundances of\nBe were determined using spectrum synthesis. Some of the stars indeed suggest a\nflattening. Between [Fe/H] ~ -2.70 and -3.26, the Be abundances stay mostly\nconstant at log(Be/H) ~ -13.2 dex. Nevertheless, for several stars we could\nonly place upper limits that are below that level. Most of the sample stars are\nconsistent with having been formed at the progenitor of the so-called\nGaia-Enceladus merger. Two out of the three stars likely formed in-situ are the\nones that deviate the most from the linear relation. The mixed origin of these\nstars offers a clue to understanding the flattening. We suggest that our\nobservations can be understood as a consequence of the inhomogeneous star\nforming conditions in the early Galaxy. Without efficient mixing, the early ISM\nwould be characterised by a large scatter in Fe abundances at a given moment.\nBeryllium, on the other hand, because of its origins in cosmic-ray spallation,\nwould have more homogeneous abundances (in a Galaxy-wide sense). We therefore\nsuggest that the observed flattening of the Be-versus-Fe relation reflects a\nstronger scatter in the Galactic Fe abundances at a given age [abridged].</td>

      <td>3D kinematics and age distribution of the Open Cluster population</td>
      <td>Open Clusters (OCs) can trace with a great accuracy the evolution of the\nGalactic disk. The aim of this work is to study the kinematical behavior of the\nOC population over time. We take advantage of the latest age determinations of\nOCs to investigate the correlations of the 6D phase space coordinates and\norbital properties with age. We also investigate the rotation curve of the\nMilky Way traced by OCs and we compare it to that of other observational or\ntheoretical studies. We gathered nearly 30000 Radial Velocity (RV) measurements\nof OC members from both Gaia-RVS data and ground based surveys and catalogues.\nWe computed the weighted mean RV, Galactic velocities and orbital parameters of\n1382 OCs. We investigated their distributions as a function of age, and by\ncomparison to field stars. We provide the largest RV catalogue available for\nOCs, half of it based on at least 3 members. Compared to field stars, we note\nthat OCs are not exactly on the same arches in the radial-azimuthal velocity\nplane, while they seem to follow the same diagonal ridges in the Galactic\nradial distribution of azimuthal velocities. Velocity ellipsoids in different\nage bins all show a clear anisotropy. The heating rate of the OC population is\nsimilar to that of field stars for the radial and azimuthal components but\nsignificantly lower for the vertical component. The rotation curve drawn by our\nsample of clusters shows several dips, which match the wiggles derived from\nnon-axisymmetric models of the Galaxy. From the computation of orbits, we\nobtain a clear dependence of the maximum height and eccentricity with age.\nFinally, the orbital characteristics of the sample of clusters as shown by the\naction variables, follow the distribution of field stars. The additional age\ninformation of the clusters points towards some (weak) age dependence of the\nknown moving groups.</td>

      <td>Action-based distribution function modelling for constraining the shape of the Galactic dark matter halo</td>
      <td>We estimate the 3D density profile of the Galactic dark matter (DM) halo\nwithin $r \lesssim 30$ kpc from the Galactic centre by using the astrometric\ndata for halo RR Lyrae stars from Gaia DR2. We model both the stellar halo\ndistribution function and the Galactic potential, fully taking into account the\nsurvey selection function, the observational errors, and the missing\nline-of-sight velocity data for RR Lyrae stars. With a Bayesian MCMC method, we\ninfer the model parameters, including the density flattening of the DM halo\n$q$, which is assumed to be constant as a function of radius. We find that 99\%\nof the posterior distribution of $q$ is located at $q>0.963$, which strongly\ndisfavours a flattened DM halo. We cannot draw any conclusions as to whether\nthe Galactic DM halo at $r \lesssim 30$ kpc is prolate, because we restrict\nourselves to axisymmetric oblate halo models with $q\leq1$. Our result is\ninconsistent with predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that\nadvocate more oblate ($\langle{q}\rangle \sim0.8 \pm 0.15$) DM halos within\n$\sim 15\%$ of the virial radius for Milky-Way-sized galaxies. An alternative\npossibility, based on our validation tests with a cosmological simulation, is\nthat the true value $q$ of the Galactic halo could be consistent with\ncosmological simulations but that disequilibrium in the Milky Way potential is\ninflating our measurement of $q$ by 0.1-0.2. As a by-product of our analysis,\nour model constrains the DM density in the Solar neighbourhood to be\n$\rho_{\mathrm{DM},\odot} = (9.01^{+0.18}_{-0.20})\times10^{-3}M_\odot\n\mathrm{pc}^{-3} = 0.342^{+0.007}_{-0.007}$ $\;\mathrm{GeV} \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.</td>

      <td>The orbital evolution of UFDs and GCs in an evolving Galactic potential</td>
      <td>We use the second Gaia data release to investigate the kinematics of 17\nultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) and 154 globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky\nWay, focusing on the differences between static and evolving models of the\nGalactic potential. An evolving potential modifies a satellite's orbit relative\nto its static equivalent, though the difference is small compared to existing\nuncertainties on orbital parameters. We find that the UFD Bo\"otes II is likely\non its first passage around the Milky Way. Depending on the assumed mass of the\nMilky Way, the UFDs Triangulum II, Hydrus I, Coma Berenices, Draco II, and Ursa\nMajor II, as well as the GC Pyxis, may also be on first infall so may be useful\nfor constraining the mass of the Galaxy. We identify a clear kinematic\ndistinction between metal-rich (${\rm [Fe/H]}>-1.1$) and metal-poor GCs (${\rm\n[Fe/H]}\leq-1.1$). Although most metal-rich clusters occupy predominately\nprograde orbits, with low eccentricities ($e\approx 0.35$) and similar specific\nangular momenta and orbital planes as the Galactic disc, 7 show potentially\nretrograde orbits, the origin of which is unclear. Metal-poor clusters have\nmore diverse orbits, higher eccentricities ($e\approx 0.65$), and half have\norbital planes offset from the disc by 60 to 120 degrees. The UFDs have similar\n$\theta$ and $\phi$ to the metal-poor GCs, suggesting a similar origin. We\nprovide a catalogue of orbital parameters for UFDs and GCs for two different\nGalaxy masses and their observational uncertainties.</td>

      <td>Gaia Early Data Release 3: Photometric content and validation</td>
      <td>Gaia Early Data Release 3 contains astrometry and photometry results for\nabout 1.8 billion sources based on observations collected by the ESA Gaia\nsatellite during the first 34 months of operations. This paper focuses on the\nphotometric content, describing the input data, the algorithms, the processing,\nand the validation of the results. Particular attention is given to the quality\nof the data and to a number of features that users may need to take into\naccount to make the best use of the EDR3 catalogue. The treatment of the BP and\nRP background has been updated to include a better estimation of the local\nbackground, and the detection of crowding effects has been used to exclude\naffected data from the calibrations. The photometric calibration models have\nalso been updated to account for flux loss over the whole magnitude range.\nSignificant improvements in the modelling and calibration of the point and line\nspread functions have also helped to reduce a number of instrumental effects\nthat were still present in DR2. EDR3 contains 1.806 billion sources with G-band\nphotometry and 1.540 billion sources with BP and RP photometry. The median\nuncertainty in the G-band photometry, as measured from the standard deviation\nof the internally calibrated mean photometry for a given source, is 0.2 mmag at\nmagnitude G=10 to 14, 0.8 mmag at G=17, and 2.6 mmag at G=19. The significant\nmagnitude term found in the Gaia DR2 photometry is no longer visible, and\noverall there are no trends larger than 1 mmag/mag. Using one passband over the\nwhole colour and magnitude range leaves no systematics above the 1% level in\nmagnitude in any of the bands, and a larger systematic is present for a very\nsmall sample of bright and blue sources. A detailed description of the residual\nsystematic effects is provided. Overall the quality of the calibrated mean\nphotometry in EDR3 is superior with respect to DR2 for all bands.</td>

      <td>Vertical stellar density distribution in a non-isothermal galactic disc</td>
      <td>The vertical density distribution of stars in a galactic disc is\ntraditionally obtained by assuming an isothermal vertical velocity dispersion\nof stars. Recent observations from SDSS, LAMOST, RAVE, Gaia etc show that this\ndispersion increases with height from the mid-plane. Here we study the\ndynamical effect of such non-isothermal dispersion on the self-consistent\nvertical density distribution for the thin disc stars in the Galaxy, obtained\nby solving together the Poisson equation and the equation of hydrostatic\nequilibrium. We find that in the non-isothermal case the mid-plane density is\nlower, and the scale height is higher than the corresponding values for the\nisothermal distribution, due to higher vertical pressure, hence the\ndistribution is vertically more extended. The change is ~35% at the solar\nradius for a stars-alone disc for the typical observed linear gradient of +6.7\nkm $s^{-1}kpc^{-1}$ and becomes even higher with increasing radii and\nincreasing gradients explored. The distribution shows a wing at high z, in\nagreement with observations, and is fitted well by a double $sech^{2}$ , which\ncould be mis-interpreted as the existence of a second, thicker disc, specially\nin external galaxies. We also consider a more realistic disc consisting of\ngravitationally coupled stars and gas in the field of dark matter halo. The\nresults show the same trend but the effect of non-isothermal dispersion is\nreduced due to the opposite, constraining effect of the gas and halo gravity.\nFurther, the non-isothermal dispersion lowers the theoretical estimate of the\ntotal mid-plane density i.e, Oort limit value, by 16%.</td>

      <td>Gaia Early Data Release 3: Acceleration of the solar system from Gaia astrometry</td>
      <td>Context. Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) provides accurate astrometry\nfor about 1.6 million compact (QSO-like) extragalactic sources, 1.2 million of\nwhich have the best-quality five-parameter astrometric solutions.\n  Aims. The proper motions of QSO-like sources are used to reveal a systematic\npattern due to the acceleration of the solar system barycentre with respect to\nthe rest frame of the Universe. Apart from being an important scientific result\nby itself, the acceleration measured in this way is a good quality indicator of\nthe Gaia astrometric solution. Methods. The effect of the acceleration is\nobtained as a part of the general expansion of the vector field of proper\nmotions in Vector Spherical Harmonics (VSH). Various versions of the VSH fit\nand various subsets of the sources are tried and compared to get the most\nconsistent result and a realistic estimate of its uncertainty. Additional tests\nwith the Gaia astrometric solution are used to get a better idea on possible\nsystematic errors in the estimate.\n  Results. Our best estimate of the acceleration based on Gaia EDR3 is $(2.32\n\pm 0.16) \times 10^{-10}$ m s${}^{-2}$ (or $7.33 \pm 0.51$ km s$^{-1}$\nMyr${}^{-1}$) towards $\alpha = 269.1^\circ \pm 5.4^\circ$, $\delta =\n-31.6^\circ \pm 4.1^\circ$, corresponding to a proper motion amplitude of $5.05\n\pm 0.35$ $\mu$as yr${}^{-1}$. This is in good agreement with the acceleration\nexpected from current models of the Galactic gravitational potential. We expect\nthat future Gaia data releases will provide estimates of the acceleration with\nuncertainties substantially below 0.1 $\mu$as yr${}^{-1}$.</td>

      <td>Ancient Very Metal-Poor Stars Associated With the Galactic Disk in the H3 Survey</td>
      <td>Ancient, very metal-poor stars offer a window into the earliest epochs of\ngalaxy formation and assembly. We combine data from the H3 Spectroscopic Survey\nand Gaia to measure metallicities, abundances of $\alpha$ elements, stellar\nages, and orbital properties of a sample of 482 very metal-poor (VMP;\n[Fe/H]$<-2$) stars in order to constrain their origins. This sample is confined\nto $1\lesssim |Z| \lesssim3$ kpc from the Galactic plane. We find that >70% of\nVMP stars near the disk are on prograde orbits and this fraction increases\ntoward lower metallicities. This result unexpected if metal-poor stars are\npredominantly accreted from many small systems with no preferred orientation,\nas such a scenario would imply a mostly isotropic distribution. Furthermore, we\nfind there is some evidence for higher fractions of prograde orbits amongst\nstars with lower [$\alpha$/Fe]. Isochrone-based ages for main sequence turn-off\nstars reveal that these VMP stars are uniformly old ($\approx12$ Gyr)\nirrespective of the $\alpha$ abundance and metallicity, suggesting that the\nmetal-poor population was not born from the same well-mixed gas disk. We\nspeculate that the VMP population has a heterogeneous origin, including both\nin-situ formation in the ancient disk and accretion from a satellite with the\nsame direction of rotation as the ancient disk at early times. Our precisely\nmeasured ages for these VMP stars on prograde orbits show that the Galaxy has\nhad a relatively quiescent merging history over most of cosmic time, and\nimplies the angular momentum alignment of the Galaxy has been in place for at\nleast 12 Gyr.</td>

      <td>Until the recent advent of $Gaia$ Data Release 2 (DR2) and deep multi-object\nspectroscopy, it has been difficult to obtain 6-D phase space information for\nlarge numbers of stars beyond 4 kpc, in particular towards the Galactic centre,\nwhere dust and crowding effects are significant. In this study we combine\nline-of-sight velocities from the Abundances and Radial velocity Galactic\nOrigins Survey (ARGOS) spectroscopic survey with proper motions from $Gaia$\nDR2, to obtain a sample of $\sim$ 7,000 red clump stars with 3-D velocities. We\nperform a large scale stellar kinematics study of the Milky Way (MW) bulge to\ncharacterize the bulge velocity ellipsoids. We measure the tilt $l_{v}$ of the\nmajor-axis of the velocity ellipsoid in the radial-longitudinal velocity plane\nin 20 fields across the bulge. The tilt or vertex deviation, is characteristic\nof non-axisymmetric systems and a significant tilt is a robust indicator of\nnon-axisymmetry or bar presence. We compare the observations to the predicted\nkinematics of an N-body boxy-bulge model formed from dynamical instabilities.\nIn the model, the $l_{v}$ values are strongly correlated with the angle\n($\alpha$) between the bulge major-axis and the Sun-Galactic centre\nline-of-sight. We use a maximum likelihood method to obtain an independent\nmeasurement of $\alpha$, from bulge stellar kinematics alone. The most likely\nvalue of $\alpha$ given our model is $\alpha = (29 \pm 3)^{\circ}$. In the\nBaade's window, the metal-rich stars display a larger vertex deviation ($l_{v}\n= -40^{\circ}$) than the metal-poor stars ($l_{v} = 10^{\circ}$) but we do not\ndetect significant $l_{v}-$metallicity trends in the other fields.</td>

      <td>The search for extratidal star candidates around Galactic globular clusters NGC 2808, NGC 6266, and NGC 6397 with {\textit{Gaia}} DR2 astrometry</td>
      <td>Context. Extratidal stars are stellar bodies that end up outside the tidal\nradius of a cluster as a result of internal processes or external forces acting\nupon it. The presence and spatial distribution of these stars can give us\ninsights into the past evolution of a cluster inside our Galaxy. Aims. Previous\nworks suggest that globular clusters, when explored in detail, show evidence of\nextratidal stars. We aim to search for possible extratidal stars in the\nGalactic globular clusters NGC 6397, NGC 2808, and NGC 6266 using the\nphotometry and proper motion measurements from Gaia DR2 database (Gaia\nCollaboration et al. 2018). Results. Finally, 120, 126, and 107 extratidal\ncandidate stars were found lying outside the tidal radius of the globular\nclusters NGC 6397, NGC 2808, and NGC 6266, respectively. 70%, 25.4%, and 72.9%\nof the extratidal stars found are located outside the Jacobi radius of NGC\n6397, NGC 2808, and NGC 6266, respectively. The spatial distribution of the\nextratidal stars belonging to NGC 6397 appears S-like, extending along the\ncurved leading and trailing arms. NGC 2808 has an overdensity of stars in the\ntrailing part of the cluster and NGC 6266 seems to have overdensities of\nextratidal stars in its eastern and northern sides. Conclusions. Proper motions\nand color-magnitude diagrams can be used to identify extratidal candidate stars\naround GCs. Nonetheless, depending on how different the kinematics and stellar\npopulations of a cluster are compared to the Milky Way field, the fraction of\ncontamination can be larger. All three clusters are found to have extratidal\nstars outside their tidal radii. For NGC 6397 and NGC 2808, these stars may be\nthe result of a combined effect of the disc shocks and tidal disruptions. For\nNGC 6266, the distribution of extratidal stars is symmetrical around it, most\nlikely indicating that the cluster has an extended stellar envelope.</td>

      <td>The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the outstanding quality of the\nsecond data release of the Gaia mission and its power for constraining many\ndifferent aspects of the dynamics of the satellites of the Milky Way. We focus\nhere on determining the proper motions of 75 Galactic globular clusters, nine\ndwarf spheroidal galaxies, one ultra-faint system, and the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds. Using data extracted from the Gaia archive, we derived the\nproper motions and parallaxes for these systems, as well as their\nuncertainties. We demonstrate that the errors, statistical and systematic, are\nrelatively well understood. We integrated the orbits of these objects in three\ndifferent Galactic potentials, and characterised their properties. We present\nthe derived proper motions, space velocities, and characteristic orbital\nparameters in various tables to facilitate their use by the astronomical\ncommunity. Our limited and straightforward analyses have allowed us for example\nto (i) determine absolute and very precise proper motions for globular\nclusters; (ii) detect clear rotation signatures in the proper motions of at\nleast five globular clusters; (iii) show that the satellites of the Milky Way\nare all on high-inclination orbits, but that they do not share a single plane\nof motion; (iv) derive a lower limit for the mass of the Milky Way of\n9.8^{+6.7}_{-2.7} x 10^{11} Msun based on the assumption that the Leo I dwarf\nspheroidal is bound; (v) derive a rotation curve for the Large Magellanic Cloud\nbased solely on proper motions that is competitive with line-of-sight velocity\ncurves, now using many orders of magnitude more sources; and (vi) unveil the\ndynamical effect of the bar on the motions of stars in the Large Magellanic\nCloud. All these results highlight the incredible power of the Gaia astrometric\nmission, and in particular of its second data release.</td>

      <td>The completeness of the Gaia catalogues heavily depends on the status of that\nspace telescope through time. Stars are only published with each of the\nastrometric, photometric and spectroscopic data products if they are detected a\nminimum number of times. If there is a gap in scientific operations, a drop in\nthe detection efficiency or Gaia deviates from the commanded scanning law, then\nstars will miss out on potential detections and thus be less likely to make it\ninto the Gaia catalogues. We lay the groundwork to retrospectively ascertain\nthe status of Gaia throughout the mission from the tens of individual\nmeasurements of the billions of stars, by developing novel methodologies to\ninfer both the orientation and angular velocity of Gaia through time and gaps\nand efficiency drops in the detections. We have applied these methodologies to\nthe Gaia DR2 variable star epoch photometry -- which are the only publicly\navailable Gaia time-series at the present time -- and make the results publicly\navailable. We accompany these results with a new Python package scanninglaw\n(https://github.com/gaiaverse/scanninglaw) that you can use to easily predict\nGaia observation times and detection probabilities for arbitrary locations on\nthe sky.</td>

      <td>Parallaxes measured by the Gaia mission have huge significance for astronomy,\nbut parallaxes in Gaia DR2 are known to have systematic errors that depend on\nthe source position and other quantities. We use the abundant information in\nfaint Milky Way stars, along with the GOG simulation of the Gaia catalog, to\nprobe the spatial dependence of Gaia DR2 parallax systematic errors in an\nempirical way. The parallax signal, concentrated in thick disk turnoff stars\nwith magnitude G ~ 17, is sufficient to construct maps of the parallax\nsystematic error over the majority of the sky. These maps show a locally\nregular "waffle pattern" on ~1 degree scales following Gaia scan directions,\nstronger linear "scar" features, and coherent variations on larger scales. The\nparallax bias maps also retain traces of astrophysical effects such as dust\nclouds. The waffle pattern, known from earlier maps of the Magellanic Clouds,\nextends over the entire sky; its local rms amplitude averages 15 microarcsec\nand varies by about a factor of two. The strength of this pattern increases by\na factor ~6 from magnitude G = 13 to G = 20. Correlations with parallaxes of\nquasars and of stars with independent distance estimates support our bias\nestimates. Using similar methods, we map systematic errors in the proper motion\nand examine the relationship with the parallax systematics. We provide a code\npackage to access and query our bias maps. Similar tests on the general stellar\npopulation should be useful in quantifying systematic errors in future Gaia\nreleases.</td>

      <td>Resonance sweeping by a decelerating Galactic bar</td>
      <td>We provide the first quantitative evidence for the deceleration of the\nGalactic bar from local stellar kinematics in agreement with dynamical friction\nby a typical dark matter halo. The kinematic response of the stellar disk to a\ndecelerating bar is studied using secular perturbation theory and test particle\nsimulations. We show that the velocity distribution at any point in the disk\naffected by a naturally slowing bar is qualitatively different from that\nperturbed by a steadily rotating bar with the same current pattern speed\n$\Omega_{\rm p}$ and amplitude. When the bar slows down, its resonances sweep\nthrough phase space, trapping and dragging along a portion of previously free\norbits. This enhances occupation on resonances, but also changes the\ndistribution of stars within the resonance. Due to the accumulation of orbits\nnear the boundary of the resonance, the decelerating bar model reproduces with\nits corotation resonance the offset and strength of the Hercules stream in the\nlocal $v_R$-$v_\varphi$ plane and the double-peaked structure of mean $v_R$ in\nthe $L_z$-$\varphi$ plane. At resonances other than the corotation, resonant\ndragging by a slowing bar is associated with a continuing increase in radial\naction, leading to multiple resonance ridges in the action plane as identified\nin the Gaia data. This work shows models using a constant bar pattern speed\nlikely lead to qualitatively wrong conclusions. Most importantly we provide a\nquantitative estimate of the current slowing rate of the bar $d\Omega_{\rm\np}/dt = (-4.5 \pm 1.4)~{\rm km} {\rm s}^{-1} {\rm kpc}^{-1} {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$\nwith additional systematic uncertainty arising from unmodeled impacts of e.g.\nspiral arms.</td>

Parallaxes and photometry tell us where the\nstars are today, when were they formed, and with what chemical content, i.e.\ntheir star formation history (SFH). We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model\nsuited to reconstruct the SFH of a resolved stellar population. We study the\nstars brighter than $G\,=\,15$ within 100 pc of the Sun in Gaia DR2 and derive\na SFH of the solar neighbourhood in agreement with previous determinations and\nimproving upon them because we detect chemical enrichment. Our results show a\nmaximum of star formation activity about 10 Gyr ago, producing large numbers of\nstars with slightly below solar metallicity (Z=0.014), followed by a decrease\nin star formation up to a minimum level occurring around 8 Gyr ago. After a\nquiet period, star formation rises to a maximum at about 5 Gyr ago, forming\nstars of solar metallicity (Z=0.017). Finally, star formation has been\ndecreasing until the present, forming stars of Z=0.03 at a residual level. We\ntest the effects introduced in the inferred SFH by ignoring the presence of\nunresolved binary stars in the sample, reducing the apparent limiting\nmagnitude, and modifying the stellar initial mass function.</td>

      <td>The projected density distribution of type ab RR Lyrae (RRab) stars was\ncharacterised from the innermost regions of the Milky Way to the halo, with the\naim of placing constraints on the Galaxys evolution. The compiled sample\n(N_RRab = 64,850) stems from fundamental mode RR Lyrae variables identified by\nthe VVV, OGLE, and Gaia surveys. The distribution is well fitted by three power\nlaws over three radial intervals. In the innermost region (R < 2.2 deg) the\ndistribution follows Sigma_RRab[1] propto R ^(-0.94 +- 0.051), while in the\nexternal region the distribution adheres to Sigma_RRab[2] propto R^(-1.50 +-\n0.019) for 2.2 deg< R <8.0 deg and Sigma_RRab[3] propto R ^(-2.43 +- 0.043) for\n8.0 deg < R <30.0 deg. Conversely, the cumulative distribution of red clump\n(RC) giants exhibits a more concentrated distribution in the mean, but in the\ncentral R < 2.2 deg the RRab population is more peaked, whereas globular\nclusters (GCs) follow a density power law (Sigma_GCs propto R ^(-1.59 +- 0.060)\nfor R<30.0 deg) similar to that of RRab stars, especially when considering a\nmore metal-poor subsample ([Fe/H]<-1.1 dex). The main conclusion emerging from\nthe analysis is that the RRab distribution favours the star cluster infall and\nmerger scenario for creating an important fraction (>18 %) of the central\nGalactic region. The radii containing half of the populations (half populations\nradii) are R_H=6.8 deg (0.99 kpc), R_H =4.2 deg (0.61 kpc), and R_H =11.9 deg\n(1.75 kpc) for the RRab stars, RC giants, and GCs, respectively. Finally,\nmerely 1% of the stars have been actually discovered in the innermost region (R\n< 35 pc) out of the expected (based on our considerations) total number of RRab\ntherein: N sim 1,562. That deficit will be substantially ameliorated with\nfuture space missions like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly\nWFIRST).</td>

While some clusters are readily\nidentifiable as NSCs, and can be readily traced back to their host galaxy\n(e.g., M54 and the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy) others have proven more elusive.\nHere we combine a number of independent constraints, focusing on their internal\nabundances and overall kinematics, to find NSCs accreted by the Galaxy and\ntrace them to their accretion event. We find that the true NSCs accreted by the\nGalaxy are: M54 from the Sagittarius Dwarf, $\omega$ Centari from\nGaia-Enceladus/Sausage, NGC 6273 from Kraken and (potentially) NGC 6934 from\nthe Helmi Streams. These NSCs are prime candidates for searches of intermediate\nmass black holes (BHs) within star clusters, given the common occurrence of\ngalaxies hosting both NSCs and central massive BHs. No NSC appears to be\nassociated with Sequoia or other minor accretion events. Other claimed NSCs are\nshown not to be such. We also discuss the peculiar case of Terzan 5, which may\nrepresent a unique case of a cluster-cluster merger.</td>

We reveal a sharp yet complex\nanticentre dominated by Monoceros (MNC) and the Anticentre Stream (ACS) in the\nnorth, which we find with an intensity comparable to the Magellanic clouds and\nthe Sagittarius stream, and by MNC south and TriAnd at negative latitudes. Our\nmethod allows us to perform a morphological analysis of MNC and ACS, both\nspanning more than 100$^\circ$ in longitude, and to provide a high purity\nsample of giants with which we track MNC down to latitudes as low as\n$\sim$5$^\circ$. Their colour-magnitude diagram is consistent with extended\nstructures at a distance of $\sim$10-11 kpc originated in the disc, with a very\nlow ratio of RR Lyrae over M giants, and kinematics compatible with the\nrotation curve at those distances or only slightly slower. We present a precise\ncharacterisation of MNC and ACS, two previously known structures that our\nmethod reveals naturally, allowing us to detect them without limiting ourselves\nto a particular stellar type and, for the first time, using only kinematics.\nOur results allow future studies to model their chemo-dynamics and evolution,\nthus constraining some of the most influential processes that shaped the MW.</td>

Using the\nkernel density estimation of stellar number counts, we identify eleven possible\nGC candidates. Crossed-matched with existing imaging data, all eleven objects\nare known either GCs or galaxies and only Fornax GC 1-6 among them are\nassociated with the targeted dwarf galaxy.

Assuming a Gaussian GC luminosity function, we compute that the\ncompleteness of the GC search is above 90 percent for most dwarf galaxies. We\nconstruct the 90 percent credible intervals/upper limits on the GC specific\nfrequency $S_{\rm N}$ of the MW dwarf galaxies: $12 < S_{\rm N} < 47$ for\nFornax, $S_{\rm N} < 20$ for the dwarfs with $-12 < M_{\rm V} < -10$, $S_{\rm\nN} < 30$ for the dwarfs with $-10 < M_{\rm V} < -7$, and $S_{\rm N} < 90$ for\nthe dwarfs with $M_{\rm V} > -7$.

      <td>Age dissection of the Milky Way discs: red giants in the Kepler field</td>
      <td>[Abridged] Ensemble studies of red-giant stars with exquisite asteroseismic,\nspectroscopic, and astrometric constraints offer a novel opportunity to recast\nand address long-standing questions concerning the evolution of stars and of\nthe Galaxy. Here, we infer masses and ages for nearly 5400 giants with\navailable Kepler light curves and APOGEE spectra, and discuss some of the\nsystematics that may affect the accuracy of the inferred stellar properties.\nFirst, we look at age-chemical-abundances relations. We find a dearth of young,\nmetal-rich stars, and the existence of a significant population of old (8-9\nGyr), low-[$\alpha$/Fe], super-solar metallicity stars, reminiscent of the age\nand metallicity of the well-studied open cluster NGC6791. The\nage-chemo-kinematic properties of these stars indicate that efficient radial\nmigration happens in the thin disk. We find that ages and masses of the nearly\n400 $\alpha$-element-rich red-giant-branch (RGB) stars in our sample are\ncompatible with those of an old (~11 Gyr), nearly coeval, chemical-thick disk\npopulation. Using a statistical model, we show that 95% of the population was\nborn within ~1.5 Gyr. Moreover, we find a difference in the vertical velocity\ndispersion between low- and high-[$\alpha$/Fe] populations, confirming their\ndifferent chemo-dynamical histories. We then exploit the almost coeval\n$\alpha$-rich population to gain insight into processes that may have altered\nthe mass of a star along its evolution, which are key to improve the mapping of\nthe observed stellar mass to age. We find evidence for a mean integrated RGB\nmass loss <$\Delta$M>= 0.10 $\pm$ 0.02 Msun and that the occurrence of massive\n(M $\gtrsim$ 1.1 Msun) $\alpha$-rich stars is of the order of 5% on the RGB,\nand significantly higher in the RC, supporting the scenario in which most of\nthese stars had undergone interaction with a companion.</td>

      <td>The RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE): Parameterisation of RAVE spectra based on convolutional neural networks</td>
      <td>In the context of large spectroscopic surveys of stars, data-driven methods\nare key in deducing physical parameters for millions of spectra in a short\ntime. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enable us to connect observables\n(e.g. spectra, stellar magnitudes) to physical properties (atmospheric\nparameters, chemical abundances, or labels in general). We trained a CNN,\nadopting stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from APOGEE\nDR16 (resolution R=22500) data as training set labels. As input, we used parts\nof the intermediate-resolution RAVE DR6 spectra (R~7500) overlapping with the\nAPOGEE DR16 data as well as broad-band ALL_WISE and 2MASS photometry, together\nwith Gaia DR2 photometry and parallaxes. We derived precise atmospheric\nparameters Teff, log(g), and [M/H] along with the chemical abundances of\n[Fe/H], [alpha/M], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ni/Fe] for 420165 RAVE\nspectra. The precision typically amounts to 60K in Teff, 0.06 in log(g) and\n0.02-0.04 dex for individual chemical abundances. Incorporating photometry and\nastrometry as additional constraints substantially improves the results in\nterms of the accuracy and precision of the derived labels. We provide a\ncatalogue of CNN-trained atmospheric parameters and abundances along with their\nuncertainties for 420165 stars in the RAVE survey. CNN-based methods provide a\npowerful way to combine spectroscopic, photometric, and astrometric data\nwithout the need to apply any priors in the form of stellar evolutionary\nmodels. The developed procedure can extend the scientific output of RAVE\nspectra beyond DR6 to ongoing and planned surveys such as Gaia RVS, 4MOST, and\nWEAVE. We call on the community to place a particular collective emphasis and\non efforts to create unbiased training samples for such future spectroscopic\nsurveys.</td>

Of\nparticular interest is a sub-sample ($\sim$11\% of the total) of low\n|Z$_{max}$| stars with low eccentricities and prograde motions. The lowest\nmetallicity of these stars has [Fe/H] = --4.30 and the sub-sample is best\ninterpreted as the very low-metallicity tail of the metal-weak thick disk\npopulation. The low |Z$_{max}$|, low eccentricity stars with retrograde orbits\nare likely accreted, while the low |Z$_{max}$|, high eccentricity pro- and\nretrograde stars are plausibly associated with the \textit{Gaia Sausage}\nsystem.

      <td>The present work explores the origin of the formation of star clusters in our\nGalaxy and in Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) through simulated H-R diagrams and\ncompare those with observed star clusters. The simulation study produces\nsynthetic H-R diagrams by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique using star\nformation history (SFH), luminosity function (LF), abundance of heavy metal (Z)\nand a big library of isochrones as basic inputs and compares them with observed\nH-R diagrams of various star clusters. The distance based comparison between\nthose two diagrams is carried out through two dimensional matching of points in\nColor-Magnitude Diagram (CMD) after optimal choice of bin size and appropriate\ndistance function. It is found that a poor medium of heavy elements (Z =\n0.0004), Gaia LF along with mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions of SFH\nmay be the origin of formation of globular clusters (GCs). On the contrary,\nenriched medium (Z = 0.019) is favoured with Gaia LF along with double power\nlaw (i.e. unimodal) SFH. For SMC clusters, the choice of exponential LF and\nexponential SFH is a proper combination for poor medium whereas Gaia LF with\nBeta type SFH is preferred in an enriched medium for the formation of star\nclusters.</td>

The MRSH stars have basically the same rotational\nvelocity, orbital eccentricity, and position in the Lindblad and Toomre diagram\nas the canonical halo stars, but they are more metal-rich. Furthermore, the\nmetallicity distribution function (MDF) of our sample stars are well fitted by\na four-Gaussian model, associated with the outer-halo, inner-halo, MRSH, and\nHVTD, respectively.

One consequence of having such a nearby and\nmassive neighbour is that the inner Milky Way is expected to be accelerated\nwith respect to our Galaxy's outskirts (beyond $\sim 30$ kpc). In this work we\ncompile a sample of $\sim 500$ stars with radial velocities in the distant\nstellar halo, $r_{\rm GC}> 50$ kpc, to test this hypothesis. These stars span a\nlarge fraction of the sky and thus give a global view of the stellar halo. We\nfind that stars in the Southern hemisphere are on average blueshifted, while\nstars in the North are redshifted, consistent with the expected, mostly\ndownwards acceleration of the inner halo due to the LMC. We compare these\nresults with simulations and find the signal is consistent with the infall of a\n$1.5\times10^{11} M_\odot$ LMC. We cross-match our stellar sample with\n\textit{Gaia} DR2 and find that the mean proper motions are not yet precise\nenough to discern the LMC's effect.

However, while useful in\nseparating GCs into individual accretion events, the orbits of GC groups\nthemselves have received less attention as probes of their progenitor galaxy\nproperties. In this work, we use simulations of galaxies and their GC systems\nfrom the E-MOSAICS project to explore how the present-day orbital properties of\nGCs are related to the properties of their progenitor galaxies. We find that\nthe orbits of GCs deposited by accretion events are sensitive to the mass and\nmerger redshift of the satellite galaxy. Earlier mergers and larger galaxy\nmasses deposit GCs at smaller median apocentres and lower total orbital energy.\nThe orbital properties of accreted groups of GCs can therefore be used to infer\nthe properties of their progenitor galaxy, though there exists a degeneracy\nbetween galaxy mass and accretion time. Combining GC orbits with other tracers\n(GC ages, metallicities) will help to break the galaxy mass/accretion time\ndegeneracy, enabling stronger constraints on the properties of their progenitor\ngalaxy. In situ GCs generally orbit at lower energies (small apocentres) than\naccreted GCs, however they exhibit a large tail to high energies and even\nretrograde orbits (relative to the present-day disc), showing significant\noverlap with accreted GCs. Applying the results to Milky Way GCs groups\nsuggests a merger redshift $z \sim 1.5$ for the Gaia Sausage/Enceladus and\n$z>2$ for the `low-energy'/Kraken group, adding further evidence that the Milky\nWay had two significant mergers in its past.</td>

However,\ndue to the limitation of accurate distance estimates, many attempts to explore\nthe extent of these Galactic features have generally been restricted to a\nvolume near the Sun. By combining Gaia DR2 astrometric solution, StarHorse\ndistance and stellar abundances from the APOGEE survey, we present the most\ndetailed and radially expansive study yet of the vertical and radial motions of\nstars in the Galactic disk. We map stellar velocity with respect to their\nGalactocentric radius, angular momentum, and azimuthal angle and assess their\nrelation to the warp. A decrease in vertical velocity is discovered at\nGalactocentric radius $R=13\ \text{kpc}$ and angular momentum $L_z=2800\\n\text{kpc}\ \text{km}\ \text{s}^{-1}$. Smaller ripples in vertical and radial\nvelocity are also discovered superposed on the main trend. We also discovered\nthat trends in the vertical velocity with azimuthal angle are not symmetric\nabout the peak, suggesting the warp to be lopsided. To explain the global trend\nin vertical velocity, we built a simple analytical model of the Galactic warp.\nOur best fit yields a starting radius of $8.87^{+0.08}_{-0.09}\ \text{kpc}$ and\nprecession rate of $13.57^{+0.20}_{-0.18}\ \text{km}\ \text{s}^{-1}\\n\text{kpc}^{-1}$. These parameters remain consistent across stellar age groups,\na result that supports the notion that the warp is the result of an external,\ngravitationally induced phenomenon.</td>

Stars with over-abundances in [Si/Fe] are\nof great interest because these have very strong silicon ($^{28}$Si) spectral\nfeatures for stars of their metallicity and evolutionary stage, offering clues\nabout rare nucleosynthetic pathways in globular clusters (GCs). Si-rich field\nstars have been conjectured to have been evaporated from GCs, however, the\norigin of their abundances remains unclear, and several scenarios have been\noffered to explain the anomalous abundance ratios.

The angular velocity of bulge RRLs is found to be\naround $35$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, significantly smaller than that for the\nmajority of bulge stars ($50-60$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$); bulge RRLs have\nlarger velocity dispersion (120$-$140 km s$^{-1}$) than younger stars. The\ndependence of the kinematics of the bulge RRLs on their metallicities is shown\nby their rotation curves and spatial distributions. Metal-poor RRLs\n([Fe/H]<$-1$) show a smaller bar angle than metal-rich ones. We also find clues\nsuggesting that RRLs in the bulge are not dominated by halo stars. These\nresults might explain some previous conflicting results over bulge RRLs and\nhelp understand the chemodynamical evolution of the Galactic bulge.</td>

      <td>The origin of galactic metal-rich stellar halo components with highly eccentric orbits</td>
      <td>Using the astrometry from the ESA's Gaia mission, previous works have shown\nthat the Milky Way stellar halo is dominated by metal-rich stars on highly\neccentric orbits. To shed light on the nature of this prominent halo component,\nwe have analysed 28 Galaxy analogues in the Auriga suite of cosmological\nhydrodynamics zoom-in simulations. Some three quarters of the Auriga galaxies\ncontain significant components with high radial velocity anisotropy, beta >\n0.6. However, only in one third of the hosts do the high-beta stars contribute\nsignificantly to the accreted stellar halo overall, similar to what is observed\nin the Milky Way. For this particular subset we reveal the origin of the\ndominant stellar halo component with high metallicity, [Fe/H]~-1, and high\norbital anisotropy, beta>0.8, by tracing their stars back to the epoch of\naccretion. It appears that, typically, these stars come from a single dwarf\ngalaxy with a stellar mass of order of 10^9-10^10 Msol that merged around 6-10\nGyr ago, causing a sharp increase in the halo mass. Our study therefore\nestablishes a firm link between the excess of radially anisotropic stellar\ndebris in the Milky Way halo and an ancient head-on collision between the young\nMilky Way and a massive dwarf galaxy</td>

      <td>Milky Way globular clusters (MW GCs) are difficult to identify at low\nGalactic latitudes because of high differential extinction and heavy star\ncrowding. The new deep near-IR images and photometry from the VISTA Variables\nin the Via L\'actea Extended Survey (VVVX) allow us to chart previously\nunexplored regions. Our long term aim is to complete the census of MW GCs. The\nimmediate goals are to estimate the astrophysical parameters, measuring their\nreddenings, extinctions, distances, total luminosities, proper motions, sizes,\nmetallicities and ages. We use the near-IR VVVX survey database, in combination\nwith Gaia DR2 optical photometry, and with the Two Micron All Sky Survey\n(2MASS) photometry. We report the detection of a heretofore unknown Galactic\nGlobular Cluster at $RA =$ 14:09:00.0; $DEC=-$65:37:12 (J2000). We calculate a\nreddening of $E(J-K_s)=(0.3\pm 0.03)$ mag and an extinction of\n$A_{K_s}=(0.15\pm 0.01)$ mag for this new GC. Its distance modulus and\ncorresponding distance were measured as $(m-M)=(15.93\pm0.03)$ mag and\n$D=(15.5\pm1.0)$ kpc, respectively. We estimate the metallicity and age by\ncomparison with known GCs and by fitting PARSEC and Dartmouth isochrones,\nfinding $[Fe/H]=(-0.70\pm0.2)$ dex and $t=(11.0\pm1.0)$ Gyr. The mean GC PMs\nfrom Gaia are $\mu_{\alpha^\ast}=(-4.68 \pm 0.47 )$ mas $yr^{-1}$ and\n$\mu_{\delta}=(-1.34 \pm 0.45)$ mas $yr^{-1}$. The total luminosity of our\ncluster is estimated to be $M_{Ks}=(-7.76\pm 0.5)$ mag. We have found a new\nlow-luminosity, old and metal-rich globular cluster, situated in the far side\nof the Galactic disk, at $R_{G}=11.2$ kpc from the Galactic centre, and at\n$z=1.0$ kpc below the plane.

Thus, the\nidentification of such kinds of stars among metal-poor field stars may provide\ninsights on the composite nature of the Milky Way (MW) bulge and inner stellar\nhalo, as well as reveal other chemical peculiarities. Here, based on APOGEE\nspectra, we report the discovery of 29 mildly metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\lesssim-0.7$)\nstars with stellar atmospheres strongly enriched in aluminum (Al-rich stars:\n[Al/Fe]$\gtrsim+0.5$), well above the typical Galactic levels, located within\nthe Solar radius toward the bulge region, which lies in highly eccentric orbits\n($e\gtrsim0.6$). We find many similarities for almost all of the chemical\nspecies measured in this work with the chemical patterns of GCs, so we\nconjecture that they have likely been dynamically ejected into the bulge and\ninner halo from GCs formed in situ and/or GC formed in different progenitors of\nknown merger events experienced by the MW, such as the\n\textit{Gaia}-Sausage-Enceladus and/or Sequoia.</td>

      <td>The Cygnus region, which dominates the local spiral arm of the Galaxy, is one\nof the nearest complexes of massive star formation. Its massive stellar\ncontent, regions of ongoing star formation, and molecular gas have been studied\nin detail. However, little is known of the history of the region beyond the\npast 10 Myr. The brightness and spectroscopic characteristics of red\nsupergiants make it easy to identify them and build up a virtually complete\nsample of such stars at the distance of the Cygnus region, thus providing a\nrecord of massive star formation extending several tens of Myr into the past, a\nperiod inaccessible through the O and early B stars observable at present. We\nhave made a selection of a sample of bright, red stars in an area of 84 square\ndegrees covering the whole present extension of the Cygnus region. We have\nobtained spectroscopy in the red visible range allowing an accurate,\nhomogeneous spectral classification as well as a reliable separation between\nsupergiants and other cool stars. Our data are complemented with Gaia Data\nRelease 2 astrometric data. We have identified 29 red supergiants in the area,\n17 of which had not been previously classified as supergiants. Twenty-four of\nthe 29 most likely belong to the Cygnus region and four of the remaining to the\nPerseus arm. We have used their derived luminosities and masses to infer the\nstar formation history of the region. Intense massive star formation activity\nis found to have started approximately 15 Myr ago, and we find evidence for two\nother episodes, one taking place between 20 and 30 Myr ago and another one\nhaving ended approximately 40 Myr ago. There are small but significant\ndifferences between the kinematic properties of red supergiants younger or\nolder then 20 Myr, hinting that stars of the older group were formed outside\nthe precursor of the present Cygnus complex, possibly in the Sagittarius-Carina\narm.</td>

The membership analysis is based on the Gaia-DR2\npositions and proper motions. The metallicity of the cluster is estimated based\non the sole RRc star known in the cluster. The Fourier decomposition of its\nlight curve leads to [Fe/H]ZW=-1:59 $\pm$ 0:23 dex. The mean cluster distance,\nestimated by several independent methods is 5.0 $\pm$ 0.3 kpc. A multi-approach\nsearch in a region of about 10x10 arcmin2 around the cluster revealed three new\nvariables, one SX Phe (V35) and two sinusoidal variables on the red giant\nbranch of unclear classification (V36,V37). Modelling the HB stars is very\nsensitive to the stellar hydrogen shell mass, which surrounds the 0.50\nM$_\odot$ helium core. To match the full stretch of the HB population, a range\nof total mass of 0.56 to 0.62 M$_\odot$ is required. These models support a\ndistance of 5.35 kpc and an age of about 13 Gyrs, and hints to some individual\nvariation of the mass loss on the uppper RGB, perhaps caused by the presence of\nclosed magnetic field in red giants.</td>

We\ninvestigated the presence of radial and vertical metallicity gradients as well\nas the possible correlations between the azimuthal velocity, $v_\phi,$ and\nmetallicity, [M/H], as qualitative indicators of the presence of mixed\npopulations.\n  Results: We find that a handful of super metal-rich stars exist on retrograde\norbits at various distances from the Galactic center and the Galactic plane. We\nalso find that the counter-rotating stars appear to be a well-mixed population,\nexhibiting radial and vertical metallicity gradients on the order of $\sim$\n-0.04 dex/kpc and -0.06 dex/kpc, respectively, with little (if any) variation\nwhen different regions of the Galaxy are probed. The prograde stars show a\n$v_\phi$-[M/H] relation that flattens -- and, perhaps, even reverses as a\nfunction of distance from the plane. Retrograde samples selected to roughly\nprobe Thamnos and Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage appear to be different populations yet\nthey also appear to be quite linked, as they follow the same trend in terms of\nthe eccentricity versus metallicity space.</td>

The level of completeness of the sample at heights between\n0.6 and 3.5 kpc is asserted by comparison with the 2 Micron All Sky Survey\ncatalogue. We show that both the density distribution and velocity dispersion\nare significantly more perturbed in the North than in the South, in all\nanalysed regions of our Galactic neighbourhoods. We provide a detailed\nassessment of these North-South asymmetries at large heights. We then proceed\nto evaluate how such asymmetries could affect determinations of the dynamical\nmatter density under equilibrium assumptions. We find that a Jeans analysis\ndelivers relatively similar vertical forces and integrated dynamical surface\ndensities at large heights above the plane in both hemispheres. At these\nheights, the densities of stars and gas are very low and the surface density is\nlargely dominated by dark matter, which allows to estimate, separately in the\nNorth and South, the local dark matter density derived under equilibrium\nassumptions. In the presence of vertical perturbations, such values should be\nconsidered as an upper limit. This Jeans analysis yields values of the local\ndark matter density above 2~kpc, $\rho_{\rm DM} \sim 0.013 \, {\rm\nM}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$ ($ \sim 0.509 \, {\rm GeV/cm}^3$) in the perturbed\nNorthern hemisphere, and $\rho_{\rm DM} \sim 0.010 \, {\rm M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$\n($ \sim 0.374 \, {\rm GeV/cm}^3$) in the much less perturbed South. As a\ncomparison, we determine the local dark matter density by fitting a global\nphase-space distribution to the data.

Most\nof the previous numerical studies conjectured that the observed structures\noriginate from orbits in resonance with the bar, based on static potential\nmodels for the Milky Way. We, in contrast, approach the problem via a\nself-consistent, dynamic, and morphologically well-resolved model, namely a\nfull $N$-body simulation of the Milky Way. Our simulation comprises about 5.1\nbillion particles in the galactic stellar bulge, bar, disk, and dark-matter\nhalo and is evolved to 10 Gyr. Our model's disk component is composed of 200\nmillion particles, and its simulation snapshots are stored every 10 Myr,\nenabling us to resolve and classify resonant orbits of representative samples\nof stars. After choosing the Sun's position in the simulation, we compare the\ndistribution of stars in its neighborhood with Gaia's astrometric data, thereby\nestablishing the role of identified resonantly trapped stars in the formation\nof Hercules-like structures. From our orbital spectral-analysis we identify\nmultiple, especially higher order resonances. Our results suggest that the\nHercules stream is dominated by the 4:1 and 5:1 outer Lindblad and corotation\nresonances. In total, this yields a trimodal structure of the Hercules stream.\nFrom the relation between resonances and ridges in phase space, our model\nfavored a slow pattern speed of the Milky-Way bar (40--45 $\mathrm{km \; s^{-1}\n\; kpc^{-1}}$).</td>

We derive\nstellar parameters using both the EW analysis and the spectral fitting\ntechnique. We compute elemental abundances for light, a-, iron-peak, and\nn-capture elements using the EW measurement approach. We investigate the origin\nof the correlation between metallicity and stellar parameters derived with the\nEW method for the coolest stars of the sample (Teff < 4300 K). The correlation\nis likely due to the challenging continuum setting and to a general inaccuracy\nof model atmospheres used to reproduce the conditions of very cool giant stars.\nWe locate the properties of our clusters in the radial distributions of\nmetallicity and abundance ratios, comparing our results with clusters from the\nGaia-ESO and APOGEE surveys. We present the [X/Fe]-[Fe/H] and [X/Fe]-Rgc trends\nfor elements in common between the two surveys and derive the C and Li\nabundances as a function of the evolutionary phase and compare them with\ntheoretical models. The SPA survey allows us to fully characterise the\nchemistry of nearby clusters. With a single set of spectra, we provide chemical\nabundances for some chemical elements, which are comparable to those obtained\nin two of the largest surveys combined. The metallicities and abundance ratios\nof our clusters fit very well in the radial distributions defined by the recent\nliterature, reinforcing the importance of star clusters to outline the spatial\ndistribution of abundances in our Galaxy. Moreover, the abundances of C and Li\nagree with evolutionary prescriptions for their masses and metallicities.</td>

      <td>The Villafranca catalog of Galactic OB groups: I. Systems with O2-O3.5 stars</td>
      <td>CONTEXT. The GOSSS spectral classifications and Gaia data have significantly\nimproved our ability to measure distances and determine memberships of stellar\ngroups with OB stars. AIMS. We have started a program to identify, measure\ndistances, and determine the membership of Galactic stellar groups with OB\nstars. We start with the identification and distance determinations of groups\nwith O stars. In this paper we concentrate on groups that contain stars with\nthe earliest spectral subtypes. METHODS. We use GOSSS to select Galactic\nstellar groups with O2-O3.5 stars and a method that combines Gaia DR2\nphotometry, positions, proper motions, and parallaxes to assign robust\nmemberships and measure distances. We also include the two clusters in that\npaper to generate our first list of 16 O-type Galactic stellar groups. RESULTS.\nWe derive distances, determine the membership, and analyze the structure of\nsixteen Galactic stellar groups with O stars, Villafranca O-001 to O-016,\nincluding the 14 groups with the earliest-O-type optically-accessible stars\nknown in the Milky Way. We compare our distance with previous results and\nestablish that the best consistency is with VLBI parallaxes and the worst is\nwith kinematic distances. Our results indicate that massive stars can form in\nrelatively low-mass clusters or even in near-isolation, as is the case for the\nBajamar star in the North America nebula. This lends support to the\nhierarchical scenario of star formation, where some stars are born in\nwell-defined bound clusters but others are born in associations that are\nunbound from the beginning: groups of newborn stars come in many shapes and\nsizes. We propose that HD 64 568 and HD 64 315 AB could have been ejected\nsimultaneously from Villafranca O-012 S. Our results are consistent with a\ndifference of approx. 20 microas in the Gaia DR2 parallax zero point between\nbright and faint stars. (ABRIDGED)</td>

We have employed the CTIO-4m telescope and the Dark Energy Camera\n(DECam) to image a contiguous $\sim 200$ sq. deg. region of the relatively less\nreddened Southern Galactic bulge, in SDSS $u$ + Pan-STARRS$grizy$. Optical\nphotometry with its large colour baseline will be used to investigate the age\nand metallicity distributions of the major structures of the bulge. Included in\nthe survey footprint are 26 globular clusters imaged in all passbands. Over\nmuch of the bulge, we have Gaia DR2 matching astrometry to $i\sim 18$, deep\nenough to reach the faint end of the red clump. This paper provides the\nbackground, scientific case, and description of the survey. We present an array\nof new reddening-corrected colour-magnitude diagrams that span the extent of\nSouthern Galactic bulge. We argue that a population of massive stars in the\nblue loop evolutionary phase, proposed to lie in the bulge, are instead at\n$\sim 2$ kpc from the Sun and likely red clump giants in the old disk. A bright\nred clump near $(l,b)=(+8^\circ,-4^\circ)$ may be a feature in the foreground\ndisk, or related to the long bar reported in earlier work. We also report the\nfirst map of the blue horizontal branch population spanning the BDBS field of\nregard, and our data does not confirm the reality of a number of proposed\nglobular clusters in the bulge.</td>

      <td>We identify shell structures in the Milky Way for the first time. We find 2\nshells in the Virgo Overdensity (VOD) region and 2 shells in the Hercules\nAquila Cloud (HAC) region using Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Gaia, and LAMOST\ndata. These shell stars are a subset of the substructure previously identified\nas the Virgo Radial Merger (VRM). Timing arguments for these shells indicate\nthat their progenitor dwarf galaxy passed through the Galactic center 2.7 +/-\n0.2 Gyr ago. Based on the time of collision, it is also possible that the VRM\nis related to the phenomenon that created phase-space spirals in the vertical\nmotion of the disk and/or the Splash, and could have caused a burst of star\nformation in the inner disk.\n  We analyze phase mixing in a collection of radial merger N-body simulations,\nand find that shell structure similar to that observed in Milky Way data\ndisappears by 5 Gyr after collision with the Galactic center. The method used\nto calculate the merger time of the VRM was able to reliably recover the\ncorrect merger times for these simulations.\n  Previous work supports the idea that the VRM and the Gaia\nSausage/Gaia-Enceladus Merger are the same. However, the Gaia Sausage is widely\nbelieved to be 8--11 Gyr old. The disparate ages could be reconciled if the\nlarger age is associated with an infall time when the progenitor crossed the\nvirial radius; we do not constrain the time at which the progenitor became\nbound to the Milky Way. Alternatively, the Gaia Sausage could be younger than\npreviously thought.</td>

The stellar overdensity extends on a large area of the sky at low\nGalactic latitudes, below the plane, and between 230$^\circ < \ell <\n255^\circ$. According to the orbit derived for Canis Major, it presents an\non-plane rotation around the Milky Way. Moreover, additional overdensities of\nBlue Plume stars are found around the plane and across the Galaxy, proving that\nthese objects are not only associated with that structure. The spatial\ndistribution of these stars, derived using Gaia astrometric data, confirms that\nthe detection of the Canis Major overdensity results more from the warped\nstructure of the Milky Way disk than from the accretion of a dwarf galaxy.</td>

The stellar ages and [$\alpha$/Fe]\nratios are measured from LAMOST spectra, using a machine learning method\ntrained with common stars in the LAMOST-APOGEE fields (for [$\alpha$/Fe]) and\nin the LAMOST-$Kepler$ fields (for stellar age). The existence of these "young"\n[$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced stars is not expected from the classical Galactic\nchemical evolution models. To explore their possible origins, we have analyzed\nthe spatial distribution, and the chemical and kinematic properties of those\nstars and compared the results with those of the chemically thin and thick disk\npopulations. We find that those "young" [$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced stars have\ndistributions in number density, metallicity, [C/N] abundance ratio, velocity\ndispersion and orbital eccentricity that are essentially the same as those of\nthe chemically thick disk population. Our results clearly show those so-called\n"young" [$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced stars are not really young but $genuinely$\n$old$.

      <td>Gravitational Potential from small-scale clustering in action space: Application to Gaia DR2</td>
      <td>Most measurements of mass in Astronomy that use kinematics of stars or gas\nrely on assumptions of equilibrium that are often hard to verify. Instead, we\ndevelop a novel idea that uses the clustering in action space, as a probe of\nunderlying gravitational potential: the correct potential should maximize\nsmall-scale clustering in the action space. We provide a first-principle\nderivation of likelihood using the two-point correlation function in action\nspace, and test it against simulations of stellar streams. We then apply this\nmethod to the 2nd data release of Gaia, and use it to measure the radial force\nfraction $f_h$ and logarithmic slope $\alpha$ of dark matter halo profile. We\ninvestigate stars within 9-11 kpc and 11.5-15 kpc from Galactic centre, and\nfind $(f_h,\alpha)= (0.391\pm 0.009, 1.835\pm 0.092) $ and $(0.351\pm\n0.012,1.687\pm 0.079)$, respectively. We also confirm that the set of\nparameters that maximize the likelihood function do correspond to the most\nclustering in the action space. The best-fit circular velocity curve for Milky\nWay potential is consistent with past measurements (although it is $\sim$\n5-10\% lower than previous methods that use masers or globular clusters).\n  Our work provides a clear demonstration of the full statistical power that\nlies in the full phase space information, relieving the need for {\it ad hoc}\nassumptions such as virial equilibrium, circular motion, or steam-finding\nalgorithms.</td>

In particular, we analyze abundance gradients\nof O, N, Fe and Mg along the thin disc as well as the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]\nrelations and the metallicity distribution functions at different\nGalactocentric distances. We run several models starting from the two-infall\nparadigm, assuming that the thick and thin discs formed by means of two\ndifferent infall episodes, and we explore several physical parameters, such as\nradial gas flows, variable efficiency of star formation, different times for\nthe maximum infall onto the disc, different distributions of the total surface\nmass density of the thick disc and enriched gas infall. Our best model suggests\nthat radial gas flows and variable efficiency of star formation should be\nacting together with the inside-out mechanism for the thin disc formation. The\ntimescale for maximum infall onto the thin disc, which determines the gap\nbetween the formation of the two discs, should be $t_{max}\simeq 3.25$ Gyr. The\nthick disc should have an exponential, small scale length density profile and\ngas infall on the inner thin disc should be enriched. We compute also the\nevolution of Gaia-Enceladus system and study the effects of possible\ninteractions with the thick and thin discs. We conclude that the gas lost by\nEnceladus or even part of it could have been responsible for the formation of\nthe thick disc but not the thin disc.</td>

We have measured the anisotropy $\beta$ as a function of\nGalactocentric radius from $5-100$ kpc for over 8600 metal poor ([Fe/H]\n$<-1.3$) halo K giants from the LAMOST catalog with line-of-sight velocities\nand distances, matched to proper motions from the second $Gaia$ data release.\nWe construct full 6-D positions and velocities for the K giants to directly\nmeasure the 3 components of the velocity dispersion $(\sigma_r, \sigma_\theta,\n\sigma_\phi)$ (in spherical coordinates). We find that the orbits in the halo\nare radial over our full Galactocentric distance range reaching over 100 kpc.\nThe anisotropy remains remarkably unchanged with Galactocentric radius from\napproximately 5 to 25 kpc, with an amplitude that depends on the metallicity of\nthe stars, dropping from $\beta \approx 0.9$ for $-1.8 \leq$ [Fe/H] $< -1.3$\n(for the bulk of the stars) to $\beta \approx 0.6$ for the lowest metallicities\n([Fe/H] $< -1.8$). Considering our sample as a whole, $\beta\approx0.8$ and,\nbeyond 25 kpc, the orbits gradually become less radial and anisotropy decreases\nto $\beta<0.3$ past 100 kpc. Within 8 kpc, $\beta<0.8$. The measurement of\nanisotropy is affected by substructure and streams, particularly beyond a\nGalactocentric distance of approximately 25 kpc, where the Sagittarius stream\nis prominent in the data. These results are complimentary to recent analysis of\nsimulations by Loebman et al. and of SDSS/$Gaia$ DR1 data by Belokurov et al.</td>

      <td>Recent statistical deconvolution methods have produced extended kinematical\nmaps in a range of heliocentric distances that are a factor of two to three\nlarger than those analysed in the Gaia Collaboration based on the same data. In\nthis paper, we use such maps to derive the rotation curve both in the Galactic\nplane and in off-plane regions and to analyse the density distribution. By\nassuming stationary equilibrium and axisymmetry, we used the Jeans equation to\nderive the rotation curve. Then we fit it with density models that include both\ndark matter and predictions of the MOND (Modified Newtonian dynamics) theory.\nSince the Milky Way exhibits deviations from axisymmetry and equilibrium, we\nalso considered corrections to the Jeans equation. To compute such corrections,\nwe ran N-body experiments of mock disk galaxies where the departure from\nequilibrium becomes larger as a function of the distance from the centre. The\nrotation curve in the outer disk of the Milky Way that is constructed with the\nJeans equation exhibits very low dependence on $R$ and $z$ and it is\nwell-fitted both by dark matter halo and MOND models. The application of the\nJeans equation for deriving the rotation curve, in the case of the systems that\ndeviate from equilibrium and axisymmetry, introduces systematic errors that\ngrow as a function of the amplitude of the average radial velocity. In the case\nof the Milky Way, we can observe that the amplitude of the radial velocity\nreaches $\sim 10\%$ that of the azimuthal one at $R\approx 20$ kpc. Based on\nthis condition, using the rotation curve obtained from the Jeans equation to\ncalculate the mass may overestimate its measurement.</td>

Our goal is to produce a catalogue of RR Lyrae stars of\nSagittarius and obtain an empiric measurement of the trends along the stream in\nsky position, distance and tangential velocities. We generate two initial\nsamples from the Gaia DR2 RR Lyrae catalogue: one, selecting only the stars\nwithin \pm20deg of the orbital plane of Sagittarius (Strip) and the other, the\nresult of applying the Pole Count Map (nGC3) algorithm. We then use the\nmodel-independent, deterministic method developed in this work to remove most\nof the contamination by detecting and isolating the stream in distance and\nproper motions. The output is two empiric catalogues: the Strip sample\n(higher-completeness, lower-purity) which contains 11 677 stars, and the nGC3\nsample (higher-purity, lower-completeness) with 6 608 stars. We characterise\nthe changes along the stream in all the available dimensions, the 5 astrometric\nones plus the metallicity, covering more than 2pi rad in the sky and obtain new\nestimates for the apocentres and the mean [Fe/H] of the RR Lyrae population.\nAlso, we show the first map of the two components of the tangential velocity,\nthanks to the combination of distances and proper motions. Finally, we detect\nthe bifurcation in the leading arm and report no significant difference between\nthe two branches, either in metallicity, kinematics or distance. We provide the\nlargest sample of RR Lyrae candidates of Sagittarius, which can be used as an\ninput for a spectroscopic follow-up or as a reference for the new generation of\nmodels of the stream through the interpolators in distance and velocity that we\nhave constructed.</td>

We have analysed the abundances of yttrium, europium,\nmagnesium and iron in Milky Way satellite galaxies, field halo stars and\nglobular clusters. The chemical information has been complemented with orbital\nparameters based on Gaia data. In particular, the orbit's average inclination\nhas been considered. The [Y/Eu] abundance behaviour with respect to the [Mg/Fe]\nturnovers for satellite galaxies of different masses reveals that higher\nluminosity systems, for which the [Mg/Fe] abundance declines at higher\nmetallicities, present enhanced [Y/Eu] abundances, particularly in the [Fe/H]\nregime between -2.25 and -1.25 dex. In addition, the analysis has uncovered a\nchemo-dynamical correlation for both globular clusters and field stars of the\nGalactic halo, accounting for about half of the [Y/Eu] abundance spread. [Y/Eu]\nunder-abundances typical of protracted chemical evolutions, are preferentially\nobserved in polar-like orbits, pointing to a possible anisotropy in the\naccretion processes. Our results strongly suggest that the observed [Y/Eu]\nabundance spread in the Milky Way halo could result from a mixture of systems\nwith different masses. They also highlight that both nature and nurture are\nrelevant to the Milky Way formation, since its primordial epochs, opening new\npathways for chemical diagnostics of our Galaxy building up.</td>

      <td>We analyse a set of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the\nformation of Milky Way-mass galaxies identified to have a prominent radially\nanisotropic stellar halo component similar to the so-called "Gaia Sausage"\nfound in the Gaia data. We examine the effects of the progenitor of the Sausage\n(the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, GES) on the formation of major galactic components\nanalogous to the Galactic thick disc and inner stellar halo. We find that the\nGES merger is likely to have been gas-rich and contribute 10-50$\%$ of gas to a\nmerger-induced centrally concentrated starburst that results in the rapid\nformation of a compact, rotationally supported thick disc that occupies the\ntypical chemical thick disc region of chemical abundance space. We find\nevidence that gas-rich mergers heated the proto-disc of the Galaxy, scattering\nstars onto less-circular orbits such that their rotation velocity and\nmetallicity positively correlate, thus contributing an additional component\nthat connects the Galactic thick disc to the inner stellar halo. We demonstrate\nthat the level of kinematic heating of the proto-galaxy correlates with the\nkinematic state of the population before the merger, the progenitor mass and\norbital eccentricity of the merger. Furthermore, we show that the mass and time\nof the merger can be accurately inferred from local stars on counter-rotating\norbits.</td>

      <td>Properties of the Milky Way's Old Populations Based on Photometric Metallicities of the OGLE RR Lyrae Stars</td>
      <td>We have used photometric data on almost 91 000 fundamental-mode RR Lyrae\nstars (type RRab) detected by the OGLE survey to investigate properties of old\npopulations in the Milky Way. Based on their metallicity distributions, we\ndemonstrate that the Galaxy is built from three distinct old components: halo,\nbulge, and disk. The distributions reach their maxima at approximately\n[Fe/H]_J95 = -1.2, -1.0, and -0.6 dex on the Jurcsik's metallicity scale,\nrespectively. We find that, very likely, the entire halo is formed from\ninfalling dwarf galaxies. It is evident that halo stars penetrate the inner\nregions of the Galactic bulge. We estimate that about one-third of all RR Lyr\nstars within the bulge area belong in fact to the halo population. The whole\nold bulge is dominated by two populations, A and B, represented by a double\nsequence in the period-amplitude (Bailey) diagram. The boundary in iron\nabundance between the halo and the disk population is at about [Fe/H]_J95 =\n-0.8 dex. Using Gaia DR2 for RRab stars in the disk area, we show that the\nobserved dispersion of proper motions along the Galactic latitude decreases\nsmoothly with the increasing metal content excluding a bump around [Fe/H]_J95 =\n-1.0 dex.</td>

We developed a Bayesian deconvolution method in two dimensions:\nextinction and distance. It uses a reference catalogue which completeness\ninformation defines the selection function. It is designed so that any\ncomplementary information from other catalogues can be added. It has also been\ndesigned to be robust to outliers, frequent in crowded fields, and differential\nextinction. The prior information is designed to be minimal: only a reference\nH-R diagram. We derived for this an empirical H-R diagram of the thin disk\nusing Gaia DR2 data and synthetic isochrone-based H-R diagrams can also be\nused.\n  Results. We validated the method on simulations and real fields using 2MASS\nand UKIDSS data complemented by Gaia DR2 photometry and parallaxes. We detail\nthe results of two test fields: a 2MASS field centred around the NGC 4815 open\ncluster which shows an over-density of both extinction and stellar density at\nthe cluster distance, and a UKIDSS field at $l=10^{\circ}$ where we recover the\nposition of the Galactic bar.</td>

Recent results have\nsuggested a decline in Li at supersolar metallicities, which may indicate\nreduced production. We exploit the unique characteristics of the Gaia-ESO\nSurvey open star cluster sample to further investigate this issue and to better\nconstrain the evolution of Li at high metallicity. We trace the the upper\nenvelope of Li abundance versus metallicity evolution using 18 clusters and\nconsidering members that should not have suffered any Li depletion. At variance\nwith previous claims, we do not find any evidence of a Li decrease at high\nmetallicity. The most metal-rich clusters in the sample ([Fe/H] about 0.3)\nactually show the highest Li abundances, with A(Li) > 3.4. Our results clearly\nshow that previous findings, which were based on field stars, were affected by\nselection effects. The metal-rich population in the solar neighbourhood is\ncomposed of relatively old and cool stars that have already undergone some Li\ndepletion; hence, their measured Li does not represent the initial interstellar\nmedium abundance, but a lower limit to it.</td>

The samples are separated\ninto two parts with\n  $6<R<12$ kpc and $12<R<20$ kpc. We derive that the decreasing rates along $Z$\nfor the two subsamples are $-3.07\pm0.63$ and $-1.89\pm0.37$ km s$^{-1}$\nkpc$^{-1}$, respectively. Compared with the TNG simulations, we suggest that\nthis trend is probably caused by the interaction between the disk and halo. The\nresults from the simulations show that only the oblate halo can provide a\ndecreasing rotational velocity with an increasing $Z$. This indicates that the\nGalactic halo is oblate with galactocentric radius $R<20$ kpc. On the other\nhand, the flaring of the disk component (mainly the thick disk) is clearly\ntraced by this study, with $R$ between 12 and 20 kpc, the disk can vertically\nextend to $6\sim10$ kpc above the disk plane. What is more interesting is that,\nwe find the\n  Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) component has a significant contribution only in\nthe halo with $R<12$ kpc, i.e. a fraction of 23$-$47\%. While in the outer\nsubsample, the contribution is too low to be well constrained.</td>

By\nexamining the metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) of stars binned in\nkinematic/action spaces, we find that the $\sqrt{J_R}$ vs $L_z$ space allows\nfor the cleanest selection of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage stars with minimal\ncontamination from disc or halo stars formed in situ or in other past mergers.\nStars with $30 \leq \sqrt{J_R} \leq 50$ (kpc km s$^{-1})^{1/2}$ and $-500 \leq\nL_z \leq 500$ kpc km s$^{-1}$ have a narrow MDF centered at [Fe/H] $= -1.17$\ndex with a dispersion of 0.34 dex. This [Fe/H] estimate is more metal-rich than\nliterature estimates by $0.1-0.3$ dex. Based on the MDFs, we find that\nselection of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage stars in other kinematic/action spaces\nwithout additional population information leads to contaminated samples. The\nclean Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage sample selected according to our criteria is\nslightly retrograde and lies along the blue sequence of the high $V_T$ halo CMD\ndual sequence. Using a galaxy mass-metallicity relation derived from\ncosmological simulations and assuming a mean stellar age of 10 Gyr we estimate\nthe mass of the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage progenitor satellite to be\n$10^{8.85-9.85}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is consistent with literature estimates\nbased on disc dynamic and simulations.

Such features\nwere predicted to exist more than ten years ago from the reaction of the Milky\nWay to a perturbation in the disc undergoing phase-mixing.

By\ntesting our method on mock data stellar streams, with realistic phase-space\ndispersions and Gaia uncertainties, we demonstrate that it is applicable to\nsmall streams out to a distance of a few kilo-parsec, and that the surface\ndensity of the disk can be determined to a precision of 6 %. This method is\ncomplementary to other mass measurements. In particular, it does not rely on\nany equilibrium assumption for stars in the Galactic disk, and also makes it\npossible to measure the surface density to good precision at large distances\nfrom the Sun.

Here we present a comprehensive\ninventory of structure within 50 kpc from the Galactic center using a sample of\n5684 giants at $|b|>40^{\circ}$ and $|Z|>2$ kpc. We identify known structures\nincluding the high-$\alpha$ disk, the in-situ halo (disk stars heated to\neccentric orbits), Sagittarius (Sgr), $Gaia$-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), the Helmi\nStreams, Sequoia, and Thamnos. Additionally, we identify the following new\nstructures: (i) Aleph ([Fe/H]$=-0.5$), a low eccentricity structure that rises\na surprising 10 kpc off the plane, (ii, iii) Arjuna ([Fe/H]$=-1.2$) and I'itoi\n([Fe/H]$<-2$), which comprise the high-energy retrograde halo along with\nSequoia, and (iv) Wukong ([Fe/H]$=-1.6$), a prograde phase-space overdensity\nchemically distinct from GSE. For each structure we provide [Fe/H],\n[$\alpha$/Fe], and orbital parameters. Stars born within the Galaxy are a major\ncomponent at $|Z|\sim$2 kpc ($\approx$60$\%$), but their relative fraction\ndeclines sharply to $\lesssim$5$\%$ past 15 kpc. Beyond 15 kpc, $>$80$\%$ of\nthe halo is built by two massive ($M_{\star}\sim10^{8}-10^{9}M_{\odot}$)\naccreted dwarfs: GSE ([Fe/H]$=-1.2$) within 25 kpc, and Sgr ([Fe/H]$=-1.0$)\nbeyond 25 kpc. This explains the relatively high overall metallicity of the\nhalo ([Fe/H]$\approx-1.2$). We attribute $\gtrsim$95$\%$ of the sample to one\nof the listed structures, pointing to a halo built entirely from accreted\ndwarfs and heating of the disk.</td>

We estimate the total He abundance of the nebulae and its\nradial abundance gradient using four different ICF(He) schemes. The slope of\nthe gradient is always negative and weakly dependent on the ICF(He) scheme,\nespecially when only the objects with log($\eta$) $<$ 0.9 are considered. The\nslope values go from $-$0.0078 to $-$0.0044 dex kpc$^{-1}$, consistent with the\npredictions of chemical evolution models of the Milky Way and chemodynamical\nsimulations of disc galaxies. Finally, we estimate the abundance deviations of\nHe, O and N in a sample of ring nebulae around Galactic WR stars, finding a\nquite similar He overabundance of about +0.24 $\pm$ 0.11 dex in three stellar\nejecta ring nebulae.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: an extremely Li-rich giant in the globular cluster NGC 1261</td>
      <td>Lithium rich stars in globular clusters are rare. In fact, only 14 have been\nfound so far, in different evolutionary phases from dwarfs to giants. Different\nmechanisms have been proposed to explain this enhancement, but it is still an\nopen problem. Using spectra collected within the Gaia-ESO Survey, obtained with\nthe GIRAFFE spectrograph at the ESO Very Large Telescope, we present the\ndiscovery of the first Li-rich star in the cluster NGC 1261, the second star\nknown in the red giant branch bump phase. The star shows an extreme Li\noverabundance of A(Li)_LTE=3.92\pm0.14, corresponding to A(Li)_NLTE=3.40 dex.\nWe propose that the Li enhancement is caused by fresh Li production through an\nextra mixing process (sometimes referred to as {\em cool bottom burning}) or\ncould be a pre-existing Li overabundance resulting from binary mass transfer,\nlikely from a red giant branch star, because of the low barium abundance. To\nunambiguously explain the Li enhancement in globular cluster stars, however, a\nreliable determination of the abundance of key species like Be, 6Li, 12C/13C,\nand several s-process elements is required, as well as detailed modeling of\nchromospheric activity indicators.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO survey: the non-universality of the age-chemical-clocks-metallicity relations in the Galactic disc</td>
      <td>In the era of large spectroscopic surveys, massive databases of high-quality\nspectra provide tools to outline a new picture of our Galaxy. In this\nframework, an important piece of information is provided by our ability to\ninfer stellar ages. We aim to provide empirical relations between stellar ages\nand abundance ratios for a sample of solar-like stars. We investigate the\ndependence on metallicity, and we apply our relations to Gaia-ESO samples of\nopen clusters and field stars. We analyse high-resolution and high-S/N HARPS\nspectra of a sample of solar-like stars to obtain precise determinations of\ntheir atmospheric parameters and abundances through differential spectral\nanalysis and age through isochrone fitting. We investigate the relations\nbetween ages and abundance ratios. For the abundance ratios with a steeper\ndependence on age, we perform multivariate linear regressions, including the\ndependence on metallicity. We apply our relations to a sample of open clusters\nlocated in 4<R$_{GC}$<16 kpc. Using them, we are able to recover the literature\nages only for clusters located at R$_{GC}$>7 kpc. In these clusters, the\ncontent of s-elements is lower than expected from chemical evolution models,\nand consequently the [s/$\alpha$] are lower than in clusters of the same age\nlocated in the solar neighbourhood. With our chemical evolution model and a set\nof empirical yields, we suggest that a strong dependence on the star formation\nhistory and metallicity-dependent yields of s-elements can substantially modify\nthe slope of the [s/$\alpha$]-[Fe/H]-age relation in different regions of the\nGalaxy. Our results point towards a non-universal relation\n[s/$\alpha$]-[Fe/H]-age, indicating the existence of relations at different\nR$_{GC}$ or for different star formation history. A better understanding of the\ns-process at high metallicity is necessary to fully understand the origin of\nthese variations.</td>

      <td>HARPS spectra with signal-to-noise ratios S/N > 600 at 6000 A were analysed\nwith MARCS model atmospheres to obtain 1D LTE abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al,\nSi, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Sr, and Y for 72 nearby solar-type stars with\nmetallicities in the range -0.3 < [Fe/H] < +0.3 and ASTEC stellar models were\nused to determine stellar ages from effective temperatures, luminosities\nobtained via Gaia DR2 parallaxes, and heavy element abundances. The resulting\nage-metallicity distribution appears to consist of two distinct populations: a\nsequence of old stars with a steep rise of [Fe/H] to about +0.3 dex at an age\nof ~7 Gyr and a younger sequence with [Fe/H] increasing from -0.3 dex to about\n+0.2 dex over the last six Gyr. Furthermore, the trends of several abundance\nratios, [O/Fe], [Na/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and [Ni/Fe], as a function of stellar age\nsplit into two corresponding sequences. The [Y/Mg]-age relation, on the other\nhand, shows no offset between the two age sequences and has no significant\ndependence on [Fe/H], but the components of a visual binary star, zeta\nReticuli, have a large and puzzling deviation. The split of the age-metallicity\ndistribution into two sequences may be interpreted as evidence of two episodes\nof accretion of gas onto the Galactic disk with a quenching of star formation\nin between. Some of the [X/Fe]-age relations support this scenario but other\nrelations are not so easy to explain, which calls for a deeper study of\nsystematic errors in the derived abundances as a function of [Fe/H], in\nparticular 3D non-LTE effects.</td>

A comparison between internal error estimates, variances derived from\nstars with more than one observing epoch and a comparison with radial\nvelocities of Gaia DR2 reveals consistently that 68% of the objects have a\nvelocity accuracy better than 1.4 km/s, while 95% of the objects have radial\nvelocities better than 4.0 km/s.

The stellar masses and ages of those stars are further\ndetermined from the LAMOST spectra, using the Kernel Principal Component\nAnalysis method, trained with thousands of RCs in the LAMOST-$Kepler$ fields\nwith accurate asteroseismic mass measurements. The purity and completeness of\nour primary RC sample are generally higher than 80 per cent. For the mass and\nage, a variety of tests show typical uncertainties of 15 and 30 per cent,\nrespectively.

Here, we focus on Li and Be in dwarf stars which\nare out of reach even in Local Group galaxies.Searching in GALAH, Gaia-ESO\nsurvey and in literature, we found several existing 7Li abundance\ndeterminations of stars belonging to the Gaia-Enceladus galaxy. The 7Li\nabundances of stars at the low metallicity end overlap with those of the\nGalactic halo.These are effective extragalactic 7Li measurements, which suggest\nthat the {\it Spite plateau} is universal, as is the cosmological Li problem.\nWe found a Li-rich giant out of 101 stars, which suggests a small percentage\nsimilar to that of the Milky Way. We also collect 9Be abundances for a\nsubsample of 25 Gaia-Enceladus stars from literature. Their abundances share\nthe Galactic [Be/H] values at the low metallicity end but grow slower with\n[Fe/H] and show a reduced dispersion. This suggests that the scatter observed\nin the Milky Way could reflect the different \beix\ evolution patterns of\ndifferent stellar components which are mixed-up in the Galactic halo.</td>

The mass models applied consist of a\nsingle exponential stellar disc, a razor thin gas disc and a constant dark\nmatter density. We first consider the simplified vertical Jeans equation which\nignores the tilt term and assumes a flat rotation curve. Under a Gaussian prior\non the total stellar surface density, the local dark matter density inferred\nfrom Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations is $0.0133_{-0.0022}^{+0.0024}\ {\rm\nM}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-3}$. The local dark matter densities for subsamples in\nan azimuthal angle range of $-10^{\circ} < \phi < 5^{\circ}$ are consistent\nwithin their 1$\sigma$ errors. However, the northern and southern subsamples\nshow a large discrepancy due to plateaux in the northern and southern vertical\nvelocity dispersion profiles. These plateaux may be the cause of the different\nestimates of the dark matter density between the north and south. Taking the\ntilt term into account has little effect on the parameter estimations and does\nnot explain the north and south asymmetry. Taking half of the difference of\n$\sigma_{z}$ profiles as unknown systematic errors, we then obtain consistent\nmeasurements for the northern and southern subsamples. We discuss the influence\nof the vertical data range, the scale height of the tracer population, the\nvertical distribution of stars and the sample size on the uncertainty of the\ndetermination of the local dark matter density.</td>

The\ndistances of the objects have been revised using Gaia parallaxes. We\nrecalculate the physical conditions and ionic abundances in an homogeneous way\nusing updated atomic data. All the objects have direct determination of the\nelectron temperature, permitting to derive their precise ionic abundances. We\nanalyze and compare different ICF schemes for each element in order to obtain\nthe most confident total abundances. Due to the revised distances, our results\ndo not support previous claims about a possible flattening of the O/H gradient\nin the inner Galactic disk. We find that the Galactic N/O gradient is rather\nflat, in contrast to what has been found in other spiral galaxies. The slope of\nthe gradients of some elements is sensitive to the ICF scheme used, especially\nin the case of Ne. The dispersion around the fit for the gradients of C, N, O,\nS, Cl and Ar is of the order of the typical uncertainties in the determination\nof the abundances, implying the absence of significant inhomogeneities in the\nchemical composition of the ionized gas phase of the ISM. We find flat\ngradients of log(S/O) and log(Cl/O) and very shallow or flat ones for log(Ne/O)\nand log(Ar/O), consistent with a lockstep evolution of Ne, S, Cl and Ar with\nrespect to O.</td>

The existence of such old and metal-rich groups in\nthe solar vicinity is quite unexpected since the vast majority of nearby moving\ngroups are known to be young. In the light of new and significantly larger data\nsets we aim to re-investigate the properties and origin of the HR 1614 moving\ngroup.\n  To identify and characterise the HR 1614 moving group we use astrometric data\nfrom Gaia DR2; distances, extinction, and reddening corrections from the\nStarHorse code; elemental abundances from the GALAH and APOGEE spectroscopic\nsurveys; and photometric metallicities from the SkyMapper survey. Bayesian ages\nwere estimated for the SkyMapper stars. Since the Hercules stream is the\nclosest kinematical structure to the HR 1614 moving group in velocity space, we\nuse it for comparison purposes. Stars that are likely to be members of the two\ngroups were selected based on their space velocities.\n  The HR 1614 moving group is located mainly at negative U velocities, does not\nform an arch of constant energy in the U-V space and is tilted in V. The\noverdensity is not chemically homogeneous but that its stars exist at a wide\nrange of both metallicities, ages, and elemental abundance ratios. They are\nessentially similar to what is observed in the Galactic thin and thick disks, a\nyounger population (~3 Gyr) that is metal-rich (-0.2<[Fe/H]<0.4) and\nalpha-poor. It should therefore not be considered as a dissolving open cluster,\nor an accreted population. We suggest that HR 1614 has a complex origin that\ncould be explained by combining several different mechanisms such as resonances\nwith the Galactic bar and spiral structure, phase-mixing of dissolving spiral\nstructure, and phase-mixing due to an external perturbation.</td>

      <td>Completeness of the Gaia-verse II: what are the odds that a star is missing from Gaia DR2?</td>
      <td>The second data release of the Gaia mission contained astrometry and\nphotometry for an incredible 1,692,919,135 sources, but how many sources did\nGaia miss and where do they lie on the sky? The answer to this question will be\ncrucial for any astronomer attempting to map the Milky Way with Gaia DR2. We\ninfer the completeness of Gaia DR2 by exploiting the fact that it only contains\nsources with at least five astrometric detections. The odds that a source\nachieves those five detections depends on both the number of observations and\nthe probability that an observation of that source results in a detection. We\npredict the number of times that each source was observed by Gaia and assume\nthat the probability of detection is either a function of magnitude or a\ndistribution as a function of magnitude. We fit both these models to the 1.7\nbillion stars of Gaia DR2, and thus are able to robustly predict the\ncompleteness of Gaia across the sky as a function of magnitude. We extend our\nselection function to account for crowding in dense regions of the sky, and\nshow that this is vitally important, particularly in the Galactic bulge and the\nLarge and Small Magellanic Clouds. We find that the magnitude limit at which\nGaia is still 99% complete varies over the sky from $G=18.9$ to $21.3$. We have\ncreated a new Python package selectionfunctions\n(https://github.com/gaiaverse/selectionfunctions) which provides easy access to\nour selection functions.</td>

      <td>From birth associations to field stars: mapping the small-scale orbit distribution in the Galactic disc</td>
      <td>Stars born at the same time in the same place should have formed from gas of\nthe same element composition. But most stars subsequently disperse from their\nbirth siblings, in orbit and orbital phase, becoming 'field stars'. Here we\nexplore and provide direct observational evidence for this process in the Milky\nWay disc, by quantifying the probability that orbit-similarity among stars\nimplies indistinguishable metallicity. We define the orbit similarity among\nstars through their distance in action-angle space, $\Delta (J,\theta)$, and\ntheir abundance similarity simply by $\Delta$[Fe/H]. Analyzing a sample of main\nsequence stars from Gaia DR2 and LAMOST, we find an excess of pairs with the\nsame metallicity ($\Delta\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<0.1$) that extends to remarkably large\nseparations in $\Delta (J,\theta)$ that correspond to nearly 1 kpc distances.\nWe assess the significance of this effect through a mock sample, drawn from a\nsmooth and phase-mixed orbit distribution. Through grouping such star pairs\ninto associations with a friend-of-friends algorithm linked by $\Delta\n(J,\theta)$, we find 100s of mono-abundance groups with $\ge 3$ (to $\gtrsim\n20$) members; these groups -- some clusters, some spread across the sky -- are\nover an order-of-magnitude more abundant than expected for a smooth phase-space\ndistribution, suggesting that we are witnessing the 'dissolution' of stellar\nbirth associations into the field.</td>

      <td>A Blueprint for the Milky Way's Stellar Populations: The Power of Large Photometric and Astrometric Surveys</td>
      <td>Recent advances from astronomical surveys have revealed spatial, chemical,\nand kinematical inhomogeneities in the inner region of the stellar halo of the\nMilky Way Galaxy. In particular, large spectroscopic surveys, combined with\nGaia astrometric data, have provided powerful tools for analyzing the detailed\nabundances and accurate kinematics for individual stars. Despite these\nnoteworthy efforts, however, spectroscopic samples are typically limited by the\nnumbers of stars considered; their analysis and interpretation are also\nhampered by the complex selection functions that are often employed. Here we\npresent a powerful alternative approach $-$ a synoptic view of the spatial,\nchemical, and kinematical distributions of stars in the Milky Way based on\nlarge photometric survey databases, enabled by a well-calibrated technique for\nobtaining individual stellar metal abundances from broad-band photometry. We\ncombine metallicities with accurate proper motions from the Gaia mission along\nthe Prime Meridian of the Galaxy, and find that various stellar components are\nclearly separated from each other in the metallicity versus rotation-velocity\nspace. The observed metallicity distribution of the inner-halo stars deviates\nfrom the traditional single-peaked distribution, and exhibits complex\nsubstructures comprising varying contributions from individual stellar\npopulations, sometimes with striking double peaks at low metallicities. The\nsubstructures revealed from our less-biased, comprehensive maps demonstrate the\nclear advantages of this approach, which can be built upon by future mixed-band\nand broad-band photometric surveys, and used as a blueprint for identifying the\nstars of greatest interest for upcoming spectroscopic studies.</td>

      <td>How Unusual is the Milky Way's Assembly History?</td>
      <td>In the $\Lambda$CDM model of structure formation galactic haloes build up by\naccretion of mass and mergers of smaller subunits. The most recent massive\nmerger event experienced by the Milky Way (MW) halo was the accretion of the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC; which has a stellar mass of $\sim \;\n10^9M_\odot$). Recent analyses of galactic stellar data from the \textit{Gaia}\nsatellite have uncovered an earlier massive accretion event, the\nGaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), which merged with the MW around 10 Gyr ago. Here,\nwe use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamics simulation to study properties of\nsimulated MW-mass haloes constrained to have accretion histories similar to\nthat of the MW, specifically the recent accretion of an "LMC" galaxy and a\n"GES'' merger, with a quiescent period between the GES merger and the infall of\nthe LMC (the "GES \& LMC" class). We find that $\sim 16$ per cent of MW-mass\nhaloes have an LMC; $\sim 5$ per cent have a GES event and no further merger\nwith an equally massive object since $z=1$; and only $0.65$ per cent belong to\nthe LMC \& GES category. The progenitors of the MWs in this last category are\nmuch less massive than average at early times but eventually catch up with the\nmean. The LMC \& GES class of galaxies naturally end up in the "blue cloud" in\nthe colour-magnitude diagram at $z=0$, tend to have a disc morphology and have\na larger than average number of satellite galaxies.</td>

We argue that the completeness is driven\nby Gaia's spinning-and-precessing scanning law and will apply this principle to\nthe Gaia-verse over this series. We take a first step by identifying the\nperiods in time that did not contribute any measurements to Gaia DR2; these\ngaps create ribbons of incompleteness across the sky that will bias any study\nthat ignores them, although some of these gaps may be filled in future data\nreleases. Our first approach was to use the variable star photometry to\nidentify the 94 gaps longer than 1% of a day. Our second approach was to\npredict the number of observations of every point on the sky, which in\ncomparison to the reported number of detections revealed additional gaps in the\nastrometry and spectroscopy. Making these predictions required us to make the\nmost precise, publicly-available determination of the Gaia scanning law. Using\nthis scanning law, we further identified that most stars fainter than $G=22$ in\nDR2 have spurious magnitudes due to a miscalibration resulting from a\nthunderstorm over Madrid. Our list of gaps and precision scanning law will\nallow astronomers to know when Gaia's eye was truly on their binary star,\nexoplanet or microlensing event during the time period of the second data\nrelease.</td>

Here we use 11,000\nmain-sequence turn-off stars with well-measured ages, [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe],\nand orbits from the H3 Survey and Gaia to time the major events in the early\nGalaxy. Located beyond the Galactic plane, $1\lesssim |Z|/\rm kpc \lesssim4$,\nthis sample contains three chemically distinct groups: a low metallicity\npopulation, and low-$\alpha$ and high-$\alpha$ groups at higher metallicity.\nThe age and orbit distributions of these populations show that: 1) the\nhigh-$\alpha$ group, which includes both disk stars and the in-situ halo, has a\nstar-formation history independent of eccentricity that abruptly truncated\n$8.3\pm0.1$ Gyr ago ($z\simeq1$); 2) the low metallicity population, which we\nidentify as the accreted stellar halo, is on eccentric orbits and its star\nformation truncated $10.2.^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ Gyr ago ($z\simeq2$); 3) the\nlow-$\alpha$ population is primarily on low eccentricity orbits and the bulk of\nits stars formed less than 8 Gyr ago. These results suggest a scenario in which\nthe Milky Way accreted a satellite galaxy at $z\approx2$ that merged with the\nearly disk by $z\approx1$. This merger truncated star formation in the early\nhigh-$\alpha$ disk and perturbed a fraction of that disk onto halo-like orbits.\nThe merger enabled the formation of a chemically distinct, low-$\alpha$ disk at\n$z\lesssim1$. The lack of any stars on halo-like orbits at younger ages\nindicates that this event was the last significant disturbance to the Milky Way\ndisk.</td>

Based on this, we have found that\nthe gravitational acceleration is not directed towards the centre of our Galaxy\nbut a few degrees away from it. We propose that the tangential acceleration\ncomponent is caused by the bar of the Galaxy. Calculations based on our model\nsuggest that the torque experienced by the region around the Sun is $\approx\n2400\, km^2 s^{-2}$ per solar mass. The mass estimate for the bar is $\sim\n1.6\pm0.3\times10^{10} M_\odot$. Using greatly improved data from Gaia DR2, we\nhave computed the acceleration field to great accuracy by adapting the oPDF\nmethod (Han et al. 2016) locally and used the phase space coordinates of $\sim\n4\times10^5$ stars within a distance of 0.5 kpc from the Sun. In the orbital\narc method, the first step is to guess an acceleration field and then\nreconstruct the stellar orbits using this acceleration for all the stars within\na specified region. Next, the stars are redistributed along orbits to check if\nthe overall phase space distribution has changed. We repeat this process until\nwe find an acceleration field that results in a new phase space distribution\nthat is the same as the one that we started with; we have then recovered the\ntrue underlying acceleration.</td>

The approach\nadvocated here is applicable to a much larger portion of Gaia DR2.

The machine is first\ntrained on simulated data using only 5D kinematics as inputs and is then\nfurther trained on a cross-matched Gaia/RAVE data set, which improves\nsensitivity to properties of the real Milky Way. The result is a catalog that\nidentifies around 767,000 accreted stars within Gaia DR2.

We adopt an axisymmetric\napproximation and use an updated Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method,\nwhich allows for a generic shape and radial orientation of the velocity\nellipsoid, as indicated by the Gaia data, to fit the mean velocities and all\nthree components of the intrinsic velocity dispersion tensor. The Milky Way is\nthe first galaxy for which all intrinsic phase space coordinates are available,\nand the kinematics are superior to the best integral-field kinematics of\nexternal galaxies. This situation removes the long-standing dynamical\ndegeneracies and makes this the first dynamical model highly over-constrained\nby the kinematics. For these reasons, our ability to fit the data provides a\nfundamental test for both galaxy dynamics and the mass distribution in the\nMilky Way disc. We tightly constrain the volume average total density\nlogarithmic slope, in the radial range 3.6--12 kpc, to be $\alpha_{\rm\ntot}=-2.149\pm 0.055$ and find that the dark halo slope must be significantly\nsteeper than $\alpha_{\rm DM}=-1$ (NFW). The dark halo shape is close to\nspherical and its density is $\rho_{\rm DM}(R_\odot)=0.0115\pm0.0020$ M$_\odot$\npc$^{-3}$ ($0.437\pm0.076$ GeV cm$^{-3}$), in agreement with previous\nestimates. The circular velocity at the solar position $v_{\rm circ}(R_{\odot})\n= 236.5\pm 3.1$ km s$^{-1}$ (including systematics) and its gently declining\nradial trends are also consistent with recent determinations.</td>

Using the Bayesian\nisochrone-fitting code {\tt StarHorse}, we derive distances, extinctions and\nastrophysical parameters for around 388,815 APOGEE stars, achieving typical\ndistance uncertainties of $\sim 6\%$ for APOGEE giants, $\sim 2\%$ for APOGEE\ndwarfs, as well as extinction uncertainties of $\sim 0.07$ mag when all\nphotometric information is available, and $\sim 0.17$ mag if optical photometry\nis missing. {\tt StarHorse} uncertainties vary with the input spectroscopic\ncatalogue, with the available photometry, and with the parallax uncertainties.\nTo illustrate the impact of our results, we show that, thanks to {\it Gaia} DR2\nand the now larger sky coverage of APOGEE-2 (including APOGEE-South), we obtain\nan extended map of the Galactic plane, providing unprecedented coverage of the\ndisk close to the Galactic mid-plane ($|Z_{Gal}|<1$ kpc) from the Galactic\nCentre out to $R_{\rm Gal}\sim 20$ kpc. The improvements in statistics as well\nas distance and extinction uncertainties unveil the presence of the bar in\nstellar density, as well as the striking chemical duality in the innermost\nregions of the disk, now clearly extending to the inner bulge. We complement\nthis paper with distances and extinctions for stars in other public released\nspectroscopic surveys: 324,999 in GALAH DR2, 4,928,715 in LAMOST DR5, 408,894\nin RAVE DR6, and 6,095 in GES DR3</td>

      <td>Chemodynamics of barred galaxies in cosmological simulations: On the Milky Way's quiescent merger history and in-situ bulge</td>
      <td>We explore the chemodynamical properties of a sample of barred galaxies in\nthe Auriga magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations, which form\nboxy/peanut (b/p) bulges, and compare these to the Milky Way (MW). We show that\nthe Auriga galaxies which best reproduce the chemodynamical properties of\nstellar populations in the MW bulge have quiescent merger histories since\nredshift $z\sim3.5$: their last major merger occurs at $t_{\rm\nlookback}>12\,\rm Gyrs$, while subsequent mergers have a stellar mass ratio of\n$\leq$1:20, suggesting an upper limit of a few percent for the mass ratio of\nthe recently proposed Gaia Sausage/Enceladus merger. These Auriga MW-analogues\nhave a negligible fraction of ex-situ stars in the b/p region ($<1\%$), with\nflattened, thick disc-like metal-poor stellar populations. The average fraction\nof ex-situ stars in the central regions of all Auriga galaxies with b/p's is 3%\n-- significantly lower than in those which do not host a b/p or a bar. While\nthe central regions of these barred galaxies contain the oldest populations,\nthey also have stars younger than 5Gyrs (>30%) and exhibit X-shaped age and\nabundance distributions. Examining the discs in our sample, we find that in\nsome cases a star-forming ring forms around the bar, which alters the\nmetallicity of the inner regions of the galaxy. Further out in the disc,\nbar-induced resonances lead to metal-rich ridges in the $V_{\phi}-r$ plane --\nthe longest of which is due to the Outer Lindblad Resonance. Our results\nsuggest the Milky Way has an uncommonly quiet merger history, which leads to an\nessentially in-situ bulge, and highlight the significant effects the bar can\nhave on the surrounding disc.</td>

      <td>Evidence for Galactic disc RR~Lyrae stars in the Solar neighbourhood</td>
      <td>We present a kinematical study of 314 RR~Lyrae stars in the solar\nneighbourhood using the publicly available photometric, spectroscopic, and {\it\nGaia} DR2 astrometric data to explore their distribution in the Milky Way. We\nreport an overdensity of 22 RR~Lyrae stars in the solar neighbourhood at a\npericenter distance of between 5--9\,kpc from the Galactic center. Their\norbital parameters and their chemistry indicate that these 22 variables share\nthe kinematics and the [Fe/H] values of the Galactic disc, with an average\nmetallicity and tangential velocity of [Fe/H]=$-0.60$\,dex and $v_{\theta} =\n241$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, respectively. From the distribution of the Galactocentric\nspherical velocity components, we find that these 22 disc-like RR~Lyrae\nvariables are not consistent with the {\it Gaia} Sausage ({\it\nGaia}-Enceladus), unlike almost half of the local RR~Lyrae stars. Chemical\ninformation from the literature shows that the majority of the selected\npericenter peak RR~Lyrae variables are $\alpha$-poor, a property shared by\ntypically much younger stars in the thin disc. Using the available photometry\nwe rule out a possible misclassification with the known classical and anomalous\nCepheids. The similar kinematic, chemical, and pulsation properties of these\ndisc RR~Lyrae stars suggest they share a common origin. In contrast, we find\nthe RR~Lyrae stars associated with the {\it Gaia}-Enceladus based on their\nkinematics and chemical composition show a considerable metallicity spread in\nthe old population ($\sim$~1\,dex).</td>

      <td>Open Clusters as Tracers on Radial Migration of the Galactic Disk</td>
      <td>Radial migration is an important process in the Galactic disk. A few open\nclusters show some evidence on this mechanism but there is no systematic study.\nIn this work, we investigate the role of radial migration on the Galactic disk\nbased on a large sample of 146 open clusters with homogeneous metallicity and\nage from Netopil et al. and kinematics calculated from Gaia DR2. The birth site\nRb, guiding radius Rg and other orbital parameters are calculated, and the\nmigration distance |Rg-Rb| is obtained, which is a combination of metallicity,\nkinematics and age information. It is found that 44% open clusters have\n|Rg-Rb|< 1 kpc, for which radial migration (churning) is not significant. Among\nthe remaining 56% open clusters with |Rg-Rb|> 1 kpc, young ones with t<1.0 Gyr\ntend to migrate inward, while older clusters usually migrate outward. Different\nmechanisms of radial migration between young and old clusters are suggested\nbased on their different migration rates, Galactic locations and orbital\nparameters. For the old group, we propose a plausible way to estimate migration\nrate and obtain a reasonable value of 1.5(+-0.5) kpc/Gyr based on ten\nintermediate-age clusters at the outer disk, where the existence of several\nspecial clusters implies its complicate formation history.</td>

      <td>The Milky Way total mass profile as inferred from Gaia DR2</td>
      <td>We determine the Milky Way (MW) mass profile inferred from fitting physically\nmotivated models to the Gaia DR2 Galactic rotation curve and other data. Using\nvarious hydrodynamical simulations of MW-mass haloes, we show that the presence\nof baryons induces a contraction of the dark matter (DM) distribution in the\ninner regions, r<20 kpc. We provide an analytic expression that relates the\nbaryonic distribution to the change in the DM halo profile. For our galaxy, the\ncontraction increases the enclosed DM halo mass by factors of roughly 1.3, 2\nand 4 at radial distances of 20, 8 and 1 kpc, respectively compared to an\nuncontracted halo. Ignoring this contraction results in systematic biases in\nthe inferred halo mass and concentration. We provide a best-fitting contracted\nNFW halo model to the MW rotation curve that matches the data very well. The\nbest-fit has a DM halo mass, $M_{200}^{\rm\nDM}=0.97_{-0.19}^{+0.24}\times10^{12} M_\odot$, and concentration before baryon\ncontraction of $9.4_{-2.6}^{+1.9}$, which lie close to the median halo\nmass--concentration relation predicted in $\Lambda$CDM. The inferred total\nmass, $M_{200}^{\rm total}=1.08_{-0.14}^{+0.20} \times 10^{12} M_\odot$, is in\ngood agreement with recent measurements. The model gives a MW stellar mass of\n$5.04_{-0.52}^{+0.43}\times10^{10} M_\odot$ and infers that the DM density at\nthe Solar position is $\rho_{\odot}^{\rm DM}=8.8_{-0.5}^{+0.5}\times10^{-3}\nM_\odot \rm{pc}^{-3}\equiv0.33_{-0.02}^{+0.02}~\rm{GeV}~\rm{cm}^{-3}$. The\nrotation curve data can also be fitted with an uncontracted NFW halo model, but\nwith very different DM and stellar parameters. The observations prefer the\nphysically motivated contracted NFW halo, but the measurement uncertainties are\ntoo large to rule out the uncontracted NFW halo.</td>

      <td>Milky Way Satellite Census. II. Galaxy--Halo Connection Constraints Including the Impact of the Large Magellanic Cloud</td>
      <td>The population of Milky Way (MW) satellites contains the faintest known\ngalaxies and thus provides essential insight into galaxy formation and dark\nmatter microphysics. Here we combine a model of the galaxy--halo connection\nwith newly derived observational selection functions based on searches for\nsatellites in photometric surveys over nearly the entire high Galactic latitude\nsky. In particular, we use cosmological zoom-in simulations of MW-like halos\nthat include realistic Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) analogs to fit the\nposition-dependent MW satellite luminosity function. We report decisive\nevidence for the statistical impact of the LMC on the MW satellite population\ndue to an estimated $6\pm 2$ observed LMC-associated satellites, consistent\nwith the number of LMC satellites inferred from Gaia proper-motion\nmeasurements, confirming the predictions of cold dark matter models for the\nexistence of satellites within satellite halos. Moreover, we infer that the LMC\nfell into the MW within the last $2\ \rm{Gyr}$ at high confidence. Based on our\ndetailed full-sky modeling, we find that the faintest observed satellites\ninhabit halos with peak virial masses below $3.2\times 10^{8}\ M_{\rm{\odot}}$\nat $95\%$ confidence, and we place the first robust constraints on the fraction\nof halos that host galaxies in this regime. We predict that the faintest\ndetectable satellites occupy halos with peak virial masses above $10^{6}\\nM_{\rm{\odot}}$, highlighting the potential for powerful galaxy formation and\ndark matter constraints from future dwarf galaxy searches.</td>

      <td>Fundamental relations for the velocity dispersion of stars in the Milky Way</td>

We find that different stellar samples, even though\nthey target different tracer populations and employ a variety of age estimation\ntechniques, follow the same set of fundamental relations. We provide the\nclearest evidence to date that, in addition to the well-known dependence on\nstellar age, the velocity dispersions of stars depend on orbital angular\nmomentum $L_z$, metallicity and height above the plane $|z|$, and are well\ndescribed by a multiplicatively separable functional form. The dispersions have\na power-law dependence on age with exponents of 0.441$\pm 0.007$ and 0.251$\pm\n0.006$ for $\sigma_z$ and $\sigma_R$ respectively, and the power law is valid\neven for the oldest stars. For the solar neighborhood stars, the apparent break\nin the power law for older stars, as seen in previous studies, is due to the\nanti-correlation of $L_z$ with age. The dispersions decrease with increasing\n$L_z$ until we reach the Sun's orbital angular momentum, after which $\sigma_z$\nincreases (implying flaring in the outer disc) while $\sigma_R$ flattens. The\ndispersions increase with decreasing metallicity, suggesting that the\ndispersions increase with birth radius. The dispersions also increase linearly\nwith $|z|$. The same set of relations that work in the solar neighborhood also\nwork for stars between $3<R/{\rm kpc}<20$. Finally, the high-[$\alpha$/Fe]\nstars follow the same relations as the low-[$\alpha$/Fe] stars.</td>

The\nanalysis of the color-magnitude diagram revealed a stellar population with an\nextended blue horizontal branch and severely affected by differential\nreddening, which was corrected taking into account color excess variations up\nto \delta E(B-V) ~ 0.51. We implemented a Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique to\nperform the isochrone fitting of the observed color-magnitude diagram in order\nto derive the stellar age, the cluster distance and the average color excess in\nthe cluster direction. Using different set of isochrones we found that NGC 6256\nis characterized by a very old stellar age around 13.0 Gyr, with a typical\nuncertainty of ~ 0.5 Gyr. We also found an average color excess E(B-V) = 1.19\nand a distance from the Sun of 6.8 kpc. We then derived the cluster\ngravitational center and measured its absolute proper motion using the Gaia-DR2\ncatalog. All this was used to back-integrate the cluster orbit in a Galaxy-like\npotential and measure its integrals of motion. It turned out that NGC 6256 is\ncurrently in a low-eccentricity orbit entirely confined within the bulge and\nits integrals of motion are fully compatible with a cluster purely belonging to\nthe Galaxy native globular cluster population. All these pieces of evidence\nsuggest that NGC 6256 is an extremely old relic of the past history of the\nGalaxy, formed during the very first stages of its assembly.</td>

Moreover, we incorporated a sample of halo\ngiant stars with a distinct chemical signature (strong CN bandheads) that\nresembles the light-elements anomaly otherwise only seen in the second\ngeneration of GC stellar populations. Using three different tagging techniques,\nwe could successfully establish unique associations between 151 extratidal\nstars in the neighborhood of eight GCs. In addition, we traced the possible\norigin of about $62\%$ of the sample of CN-strong giants to their potential\nhost clusters. Several of the involved GCs have been brought into connection\nwith the Gaia-Enceladus and Sequoia merger events. By establishing kinematic\nand chemical connections between 17 CN-strong stars and their surrounding\nfields, we could identify co-moving groups of stars at the same [Fe/H] with a\npossible cluster origin. We found strong evidence that four CN-strong stars and\ntheir associates are connected to the Sagittarius stream whilst their tightly\nconfined [Fe/H] may hint to a birth site in M 54. Finally, we provide tentative\nestimates for the fraction of first-generation cluster stars among all stars\nlost to the halo. In the immediate cluster vicinity, this value amounts to\n$50.0\pm16.7\%$ while the associations in the halo field rather imply\n$80.2_{-5.2}^{+4.9}\%$. We speculate that -- if proven real by spectroscopic\nfollow-up -- the disparity between these numbers could indicate a major\ncontribution of low-mass clusters to the overall number of stars escaped to the\nhalo or, alternatively, point toward a strong mass loss from the first\ngeneration during early cluster dissolution.

We first determine the anisotropy parameter $\beta$, and the tracer\nsatellites' radial density index $\gamma$ to be $\beta$=$-0.67^{+0.45}_{-0.62}$\nand $\gamma=2.11\pm0.23$. When we exclude possible former satellites of the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud, the anisotropy changes to\n$\beta$=$-0.21^{+0.37}_{-0.51}$. We find that the index of the Milky Way's\ngravitational potential $\alpha$, which is dependent on the mass itself, is the\nparameter with the largest impact on the mass determination. Via comparison\nwith cosmological simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies, we carried out a\ndetailed analysis of the estimation of the observational uncertainties and\ntheir impact on the mass estimator. We found that the mass estimator is biased\nwhen applied naively to the satellites of simulated Milky Way halos. Correcting\nfor this bias, we obtain for our Galaxy a mass of\n$0.58^{+0.15}_{-0.14}\times10^{12}$M$_\odot$ within 64 kpc, as computed from\nthe inner half of our observational sample, and\n$1.43^{+0.35}_{-0.32}\times10^{12}$M$_\odot$ within 273 kpc, from the full\nsample; this latter value extrapolates to a virial mass of\n$M_\mathrm{vir\,\Delta=97}$=$1.51^{+0.45}_{-0.40} \times 10^{12}M_{\odot}$\ncorresponding to a virial radius of R$_\mathrm{vir}$=$308\pm29$ kpc.

      <td>AIMS. We calculate the stellar density using star counts obtained from Gaia\nDR2 up to a Galactocentric distance R=20 kpc with a deconvolution technique for\nthe parallax errors. Then we analyse the density in order to study the\nstructure of the outer Galactic disc, mainly the warp.\n  METHODS. In order to carry out the deconvolution, we used the Lucy inversion\ntechnique for recovering the corrected star counts. We also used the Gaia\nluminosity function of stars with $M_G<10$ to extract the stellar density from\nthe star counts.\n  RESULTS. The stellar density maps can be fitted by an exponential disc in the\nradial direction $h_r=2.07\pm0.07$ kpc, with a weak dependence on the azimuth,\nextended up to 20 kpc without any cut-off. The flare and warp are clearly\nvisible. The best fit of a symmetrical S-shaped warp gives $z_w= z_\odot+(37\pm\n4.2(stat.)-0.91(syst.))$ pc $(R/R_\odot )^{2.42\pm 0.76(stat.) + 0.129 (syst.)}\nsin(\phi+9.3\pm 7.37 (stat.) +4.48 (syst.))$ for the whole population. When we\nanalyse the northern and southern warps separately, we obtain an asymmetry of\nan $\sim25\%$ larger amplitude in the north. This result may be influenced by\nextinction because the Gaia G band is quite prone to extinction biases.\nHowever, we tested the accuracy of the extinction map we used, which shows that\nthe extinction is determined very well in the outer disc. Nevertheless, we\nrecall that we do not know the full extinction error, and neither do we know\nthe systematic error of the map, which may influence the final result.\n  The analysis was also carried out for very luminous stars alone ($M_G<-2$),\nwhich on average represents a younger population. We obtain similar\nscale-length values, while the maximum amplitude of the warp is $20-30\%$\nlarger than with the whole population. The north-south asymmetry is maintained.</td>

The static components of each galaxy model are the\nbulge, disk, and halo, while the various time-dependent components include a\nbar, spiral arms, and GMCs. In galaxy models without GMCs, simulated solar\nsiblings all have $J_R < 122$ km $\rm s^{-1}$ kpc, $990 < L_z < 1986$ km $\rm\ns^{-1}$ kpc, and $0.15 < J_z < 0.58$ km $\rm s^{-1}$ kpc. Given the actions of\nstars in APOGEE and $Gaia$, we find 104 stars that fall within this range. One\ncandidate in particular, Solar Sibling 1, has both chemistry and actions\nsimilar enough to the solar values that strong interactions with the bar or\nspiral arms are not required for it to be dynamically associated with the Sun.\nAdding GMCs to the potential can eject solar siblings out of the plane of the\ndisk and increase their $J_z$, resulting in a final candidate list of 296\nstars. The entire suite of simulations indicate that solar siblings should have\n$J_R < 122$ km $\rm s^{-1}$ kpc, $353 < L_z < 2110$ km $\rm s^{-1}$ kpc, and\n$J_z < 0.8$ km $\rm s^{-1}$ kpc.

The continuity of these properties with stars at\nboth higher ($\rm [Fe/H]>-2$) and lower metallicities ($\rm [Fe/H]<-4.$)\nsuggests that the Galaxy at $\rm [Fe/H] \lesssim -0.5$ and down to at least\n$\rm [Fe/H]\sim-6$ is dominated by these two populations. In particular, we\nshow that the disc extends continuously from $\rm [Fe/H] \le -4$ (where stars\nwith disc-like kinematics have been recently discovered) up to $\rm [Fe/H] \ge\n-2$, the metallicity regime of the Galactic thick disc. There exists indeed an\n"ultra-metal poor thick disc", which constitutes the extremely metal-poor tail\nof the canonical Galactic thick disc, and which extends this latter from $\rm\n[Fe/H] \sim -0.5$ up to the most metal-poor stars discovered in the Galaxy up\nto date. These results suggest that the disc may be the main, and possibly the\nonly stellar population that has formed in the Galaxy at these metallicities.\nThis requires that the dissipative collapse that led to the formation of the\nold Galactic disc must have been extremely fast. We also discuss these results\nin the light of recent simulation efforts made to reproduce the first stages of\nMilky Way-type galaxies.</td>

Whether\nor not the dSphs are on their first infall cannot be resolved on the sole basis\nof their star formation history. In fact, gas removal may cause complex\ngravitational instabilities and near-pericenter passages can give rise to tidal\ndisruptive processes. Advanced precision with the Gaia satellite in determining\nboth their past orbital motions and the MW velocity curve is, however,\nproviding crucial results.\n  First, tidal shocks explain why DM-free dSphs are found preferentially near\ntheir pericenter, where they are in a destructive process, while their chance\nto be long-lived satellites is associated with a very low probability P~ 2\n10^-7, which is at odds with the current DM-dominated dSph scenario. Second,\nmost dSph binding energies are consistent with a first infall. Third, the MW\ntidal shocks that predict the observed dSph velocity dispersions are themselves\npredicted in amplitude by the most accurate MW velocity curve. Fourth, tidal\nshocks accurately predict the forces or accelerations exerted at half-light\nradius of dSphs, including the MW and the Magellanic System gravitational\nattractions.\n  The above is suggestive of dSphs that are DM-free and tidally shocked near\ntheir pericenters, which may provoke a significant quake in our understanding\nof near-field cosmology.</td>

This\nevent, known as the Gaia-Enceladus/Gaia-Sausage (GE/GS), is also hypothesized\nto have built the majority of the inner stellar halo. We use the cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulation Illustris to place this merger in the context of galaxy\nassembly within $\Lambda$CDM. From $\sim$150 MW analogs, $\sim 80 \%$ have\nexperienced at least one merger of similar mass and infall time as GE/GS.\nWithin this sample, 37 have debris as radial as that of the GE/GS, which we dub\nthe Ancient Radial Mergers (ARMs). Counterrotation is not rare among ARMs, with\n$43 \%$ having $>40 \%$ of their debris in counterrotating orbits. However, the\ncompactness inferred for the GE/GS debris, given its large $\beta$ and its\nsubstantial contribution to the stellar halo, is more difficult to reproduce.\nThe median radius of ARM debris is r$_{*,deb}\simeq 45$kpc, while GE/GS is\nthought to be mostly contained within $r\sim 30$ kpc. For most MW analogs, a\nfew mergers are required to build the inner stellar halo, and ARM debris only\naccounts for $\sim 12 \%$ of inner accreted stars. Encouragingly, we find one\nARM that is both compact and dominates the inner halo of its central, making it\nour best GE/GS analog. Interestingly, this merger deposits a significant number\nof stars (M$_*\simeq1.5 \times 10^9 M_\odot$) in the outer halo, suggesting\nthat an undiscovered section of GE/GS may await detection.</td>

      <td>Globular clusters (GCs) formed when the Milky Way experienced a phase of\nrapid assembly. We use the wealth of information contained in the Galactic GC\npopulation to quantify the properties of the satellite galaxies from which the\nMilky Way assembled. To achieve this, we train an artificial neural network on\nthe E-MOSAICS cosmological simulations of the co-formation and co-evolution of\nGCs and their host galaxies. The network uses the ages, metallicities, and\norbital properties of GCs that formed in the same progenitor galaxies to\npredict the stellar masses and accretion redshifts of these progenitors. We\napply the network to Galactic GCs associated with five progenitors: {\it\nGaia}-Enceladus, the Helmi streams, Sequoia, Sagittarius, and the recently\ndiscovered, `low-energy' GCs, which provide an excellent match to the predicted\nproperties of the enigmatic galaxy `Kraken'. The five galaxies cover a narrow\nstellar mass range [$M_\star=(0.6{-}4.6)\times10^8~{\rm M}_\odot$], but have\nwidely different accretion redshifts ($z_{\rm acc}=0.57{-}2.65$). All accretion\nevents represent minor mergers, but Kraken likely represents the most major\nmerger ever experienced by the Milky Way, with stellar and virial mass ratios\nof $r_{M_\star}=1$:$31^{+34}_{-16}$ and $r_{M_{\rm h}}=1$:$7^{+4}_{-2}$,\nrespectively. The progenitors match the $z=0$ relation between GC number and\nhalo virial mass, but have elevated specific frequencies, suggesting an\nevolution with redshift. Even though these progenitors likely were the Milky\nWay's most massive accretion events, they contributed a total mass of only\n$\log{(M_{\rm \star,tot}/{\rm M}_\odot)}=9.0\pm0.1$, similar to the stellar\nhalo. This implies that the Milky Way grew its stellar mass mostly by in-situ\nstar formation. We conclude by organising these accretion events into the most\ndetailed reconstruction to date of the Milky Way's merger tree.</td>

The Fourier decomposition of RR Lyrae light curves lead to the\nestimation of mean [Fe/H]$_{\rm spec}=-2.20\pm 0.18$, and distance of\n$8.3\pm0.2$ kpc. Four new variables are reported; one RRd (V40), a multimode SX\nPhe (V41), a SR (V42) and one RRc (F1) that is most likely not a cluster\nmember. The AC nature of V7 is confirmed. The double mode nature of the RRc\nstar V11 is not confirmed and its amplitude modulations are most likely due to\nthe Blazhko effect. Two modes are found in the known RRc variable V13. It is\nargued that the variable V30, previously classified as RRab is, in fact, an BL\nHer-type star not belonging to the cluster. Making use of the $Gaia$-DR2 proper\nmotions, we identified 5012 stars in the field of the cluster, that are very\nlikely cluster members, and for which we possess photometry, enabling the\nproduction of a refined Colour-Magnitude Diagram.

For Gru II we place an upper limit (90%\nconfidence) on the dispersion of sigma < 1.9 km/s, and for Tuc V we do not\nobtain any useful limits. All three satellites have metallicities below [Fe/H]\n= -2.1, but none has a detectable metallicity spread. We determine proper\nmotions for each satellite based on Gaia astrometry and compute their orbits\naround the Milky Way. Gru II is on a tightly bound orbit with a pericenter of\n25 kpc and orbital eccentricity of 0.45. Tuc V likely has an apocenter beyond\n100 kpc, and could be approaching the Milky Way for the first time. The current\norbit of Tuc IV is similar to that of Gru II, with a pericenter of 25 kpc and\nan eccentricity of 0.36. However, a backward integration of the position of Tuc\nIV demonstrates that it collided with the Large Magellanic Cloud at an impact\nparameter of 4 kpc ~120 Myr ago, deflecting its trajectory and possibly\naltering its internal kinematics.

Here, we present the IGAPS\npoint source catalogue. It contains 295.4 million rows providing photometry in\nthe filters, i, r, narrow-band Halpha, g and U_RGO. The IGAPS footprint fills\nthe Galactic coordinate range, |b| < 5deg and 30deg < l < 215deg. A uniform\ncalibration, referred to the Pan-STARRS system, is applied to g, r and i, while\nthe Halpha calibration is linked to r and then is reconciled via field\noverlaps. The astrometry in all 5 bands has been recalculated on the Gaia DR2\nframe. Down to i ~ 20 mag (Vega system), most stars are also detected in g, r\nand Halpha. As exposures in the r band were obtained within the IPHAS and UVEX\nsurveys a few years apart, typically, the catalogue includes two distinct r\nmeasures, r_I and r_U. The r 10sigma limiting magnitude is ~21, with median\nseeing 1.1 arcsec. Between ~13th and ~19th magnitudes in all bands, the\nphotometry is internally reproducible to within 0.02 magnitudes. Stars brighter\nthan r=19.5 have been tested for narrow-band Halpha excess signalling line\nemission, and for variation exceeding |r_I-r_U| = 0.2 mag. We find and flag\n8292 candidate emission line stars and over 53000 variables (both at >5sigma\nconfidence). The 174-column catalogue will be available via CDS Strasbourg.</td>

For instance, if dark matter\naggregates into massive sub-halos, these perturbers are expected to scatter\nstars out of dynamically cold stellar streams, possibly leading to detectable\ngaps in those structures. Here we re-examine the density variations in the GD-1\nstream, using Gaia DR2 astrometry, Pan-STARRS photometry, together with high\nprecision radial velocities measured with the CFHT/ESPaDOnS and VLT/UVES\ninstruments and complemented with public radial velocity catalogs. We show that\nafter correcting for projection effects, the density profile exhibits high\ncontrast periodic peaks, separated by $2.64\pm0.18$ kpc. An N-body simulation\nis presented that reproduces this striking morphology with simple epicyclic\nmotion in a smooth Galactic potential. We also discuss the reliability of\nmeasuring density variations using ground-based photometric surveys, and for\nthe particular case of GD-1 we highlight some of the artifacts present in the\nGaia DR2 catalog along its track. Massive dark subhalos do not appear to be\nrequired to explain the density clumping along GD-1.</td>

At its present Galactocentric position\n$(R, z) \sim (23, 15)~{\rm kpc}$, the association is (on the sky) near the\nleading arm of the gas stream emanating from the Magellanic cloud system, but\nis located $\approx 60^\circ$ from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) center on\nthe other side of the Milky Way disk. If we assume that the cluster is\nco-located with HI gas in the stream, we directly measure the distance to the\nleading arm of the Magellanic stream. The measured distance is inconsistent\nwith stream predictions from models of the LMC/SMC interaction and infall into\nthe Milky Way that do not account for ram pressure and gas interaction with\nMilky Way disk. The estimated age of the cluster is consistent with the time of\nlast passage of the leading arm gas through the Galactic midplane, and we\ntherefore speculate that this star-formation event was triggered by its the\nlast disk midplane passage. Most details of this idea remain a puzzle: the\nMagellanic stream has low column density, the Milky Way disk at this large\nradius has low gas density, and the relative velocity of the leading arm gas\nand Milky Way gas is large. However it formed, the discovery of a young stellar\ncluster in the Milky Way halo presents an interesting opportunity for study.\nThis cluster was discovered with Gaia astrometry and photometry alone, but\nfolow-up DECam photometry was crucial for measuring its properties.</td>

Various tests show that our analyses yield\nmetallicities with a typical precision of 0.20\,dex and systemic radial\nvelocities with uncertainties ranging from 5 to 21\,km\,s$^{-1}$ (depending on\nthe number of radial velocity measurements available for a given star). Based\non the well calibrated near-infrared $PM_{W1}Z$ or $PM_{K_{\rm s}}Z$, and\n$M_{V}$-[Fe/H] relations, precise distances are derived for these RRLs.\nFinally, we include Gaia DR2 proper motions in our catalog.

From these stars, we determine the proper motion\nalong the Sagittarius stream, making it the proper motion sequence with the\nlargest span and continuity ever measured for a stream. A first comparison with\nexisting N-body models of the stream reveals some discrepancies, especially\nnear the pericentre of the trailing arm and an overestimation of the total\nproper motion for the leading arm. Our study can be the starting point for\ndetermining the variation of the population of stars along the stream, the\ndistance to the stream with red clump stars, and the solar motion.

From the proper motion analysis we\nfound evidence of non-member stars in the FoV of the cluster being tidally\naffected by the gravitational pull of the bulge of the Galaxy.

      <td>The on-going vertical phase mixing, manifesting itself as a snail shell in\nthe $Z-V_{Z}$ phase space, has been discovered with the Gaia DR2 data. To\nbetter understand the origin and properties of the phase mixing process, we\nstudy the vertical phase-mixing signatures in arches (including the classical\n``moving groups'') of the $V_{R}-V_{\phi}$ phase space near the Solar circle.\nInterestingly, the phase space snail shell exists only in the arches with\n$|V_{\phi} - V_{\rm LSR}| \lesssim 30$ km/s, i.e., stars on dynamically\n``colder'' orbits. The snail shell becomes much weaker and eventually\ndisappears for increasingly larger radial action ($J_{R}$), quantifying the\n``hotness'' of orbits. Thus one should pay closer attention to the colder\norbits in future phase mixing studies. We also confirm that the Hercules stream\nhas two branches (at fast and slow $V_{\phi}$), which may not be explained by a\nsingle mechanism, since only the fast branch shows the prominent snail shell\nfeature. The hotter orbits may have phase-wrapped away already due to the much\nlarger dynamical range in radial variation to facilitate faster phase mixing.\nTo explain the lack of a well-defined snail shell in the hotter orbits, the\ndisk should have been perturbed at least $500$ Myr ago. Our results offer more\nsupport to the recent satellite-disk encounter scenario than the internal bar\nbuckling perturbation scenario as the origin of the phase space mixing. Origin\nof the more prominent snail shell in the $V_{\phi}$ color-coded phase space is\nalso discussed.</td>

It added the range of\nGalactocentric distances between 13 kpc and 20 kpc to the previous maps.\n  Aims: Here, we investigate the dynamical effects produced by different\nmechanisms that can explain the radial and vertical components of these\nextended kinematic maps, including a decomposition of bending and breathing of\nthe vertical components. This paper as a whole tries to be a compendium of\ndifferent dynamical mechanisms whose predictions can be compared to the\nkinematic maps.\n  Methods: Using analytical methods or simulations, we are able to predict the\nmain dynamical factors and compare them to the predictions of the extended\nkinematic maps of Gaia-DR2.\n  Results: The gravitational influence of Galactic components that are\ndifferent from the disk, such as the long bar or bulge, the spiral arms, or a\ntidal interaction with Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, may explain some features of\nthe velocity maps, especially in the inner parts of the disk. However, they are\nnot sufficient in explaining the most conspicuous gradients in the outer disk.\nVertical motions might be dominated by external perturbations or mergers,\nalthough a minor component may be due to a warp whose amplitude evolves with\ntime. Here, we show with two different methods, which analyze the dispersion of\nvelocities, that the mass distribution of the disk is flared. Despite these\npartial explanations, the main observed features can only be explained in terms\nof out-of-equilibrium models, which are either due to external perturbers or to\nthe fact that the disk has not had time to reach equilibrium since its\nformation.</td>

      <td>Although the stellar halo accounts for just ~1% of the total stellar mass of\nthe Milky Way, the kinematics of halo stars encode valuable information about\nthe origins and evolution of our Galaxy. It has been shown that the high\ntransverse velocity stars in Gaia DR2 reveal a double sequence in the\nHertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, indicating a bifurcation in the local stellar\nhalo within 1 kpc. We fit these stars by updating the popular\nBesan\c{c}on/Galaxia model, incorporating the latest observational results for\nthe stellar halo and an improved kinematic description for the thick-disk from\nSch\"onrich & Binney (2012). We are able to obtain a good match to the Gaia\ndata and provide new constraints on the properties of the Galactic disc and\nstellar halo. In particular, we show that the kinematically defined thick disc\ncontribution to this high velocity tail is ~13%. We look in greater detail\nusing chemistry from LAMOST DR5, identifying a population of retrograde stars\nwith thick-disc chemistry. Our thick disc kinematic model cannot account for\nthis population and so we conclude there is likely to be a contribution from\nheated or accreted stars in the Solar Neighbourhood. We also investigate\nproposed dynamical substructures in this sample, concluding that they are\nprobably due to resonant orbits rather than accreted populations. Finally we\nprovide new insights on the nature of the two sequences and their relation with\npast accretion events and the primordial Galactic disc.</td>

One can clearly see the metallicity jump of 0.22 in [Fe/H] at a\nGalactocentric distance of about 9.5 kpc, which appears to be linked to the\nouter boundary of the thinnest and youngest component of the galactic disk. The\nabsence of a significant metallicity gradient in the internal (R<9 kpc) and\nexternal (R>10 kpc) regions of the disk demonstrates the absence of noticeable\nmetal enrichment at times of the order of the ages corresponding to those of\nthe disk regions under consideration. Observational data show that the disk\nexperiences noticeable metal enrichment only during the starburst epochs. No\nsignificant dependence was found between the average metallicity and the age of\nthe clusters.</td>

      <td>In this paper we introduce a new method for analysing Milky Way phase-space\nwhich allows us to reveal the imprint left by the Milky Way bar and spiral arms\non the stars with full phase-space data in Gaia Data Release 2. The\nunprecedented quality and extended spatial coverage of these data enable us to\ndiscover six prominent stellar density structures in the disc to a distance of\n5 kpc from the Sun. Four of these structures correspond to the spiral arms\ndetected previously in the gas and young stars (Scutum-Centaurus, Sagittarius,\nLocal and Perseus). The remaining two are associated with the main resonances\nof the Milky Way bar where corotation is placed at around 6.2 kpc and the outer\nLindblad resonance beyond the Solar radius, at around 9 kpc. For the first time\nwe provide evidence of the imprint left by spiral arms and resonances in the\nstellar densities not relying on a specific tracer, through enhancing the\nsignatures left by these asymmetries. Our method offers new avenues for\nstudying how the stellar populations in our Galaxy are shaped.</td>

We obtain 4.55(3) and 4.50(7) kpc,\nrespectively - values compatible within 1 sigma with recent estimates based on\nGaia DR2 parallaxes. By comparing the M - R diagram of the two binaries and the\ncolor-magnitude diagram of 47 Tuc to Dartmouth model isochrones we estimate the\nage of the cluster to be 12.0 pm 0.5 Gyr, and the helium abundance of the\ncluster to be Y approx 0.25.</td>

By combining Gaia\nastrometric data with the Galactic rotation curve and distances to Cepheids\nfrom our sample, we construct a map of the vertical component of the velocity\nvector for all Cepheids in the Milky Way disk. We find large-scale vertical\nmotions with amplitudes of 10-20 km/s, such that Cepheids located in the\nnorthern warp exhibit large positive vertical velocity (toward the north\nGalactic pole), whereas those in the southern warp - negative vertical velocity\n(toward the south Galactic pole).</td>

      <td>The self-consistent vertical density distribution in a thin, isothermal disc\nis typically given by a sech^2 law, as shown in the classic work by Spitzer\n(1942). This is obtained assuming that the radial and vertical motions are\ndecoupled and only the vertical term is used in the Poisson equation. We argue\nthat in the region of low density as in the outer disc this treatment is no\nlonger valid. We develop a general, complete model that includes both radial\nand vertical terms in the Poisson equation and write these in terms of the full\nradial and vertical Jeans equations which take account of the non-flat observed\nrotation curve, the random motions, and the cross term that indicates the\ntilted stellar velocity ellipsoid. We apply it to the Milky Way and show that\nthese additional effects change the resulting density distribution\nsignificantly, such that the mid-plane density is higher and the disc thickness\n(HWHM) is lower by 30-40% in the outer Galaxy. Further, the vertical\ndistribution is no longer given as a sech^2 function even for an isothermal\ncase. These predicted differences are now within the verification limit of new,\nhigh-resolution data for example from GAIA and hence could be confirmed.</td>

With a model of Sgr tidal disruption providing estimated\ndynamical ages (i.e., stripping times) for each stream star, we find a mean\nmetallicity gradient of 0.12 +/- 0.03 dex/Gyr for stars stripped from Sgr over\ntime. For the first time, an [$\alpha$/Fe] gradient is also measured within the\nstream, at 0.02 +/- 0.01 dex/Gyr using magnesium abundances and 0.04 +/- 0.01\ndex/Gyr using silicon, which imply that the Sgr progenitor had significant\nradial abundance gradients. We discuss the magnitude of those inferred\ngradients and their implication for the nature of the Sgr progenitor within the\ncontext of the current family of Milky Way satellite galaxies, and suggest that\nmore sophisticated Sgr models are needed to properly interpret the growing\nchemodynamical detail we have on the Sgr system.</td>

      <td>The Milky Way bar/bulge in proper motions: a 3D view from VIRAC & Gaia</td>

We present these as both integrated on-sky maps and, after\nisolating standard candle red clump (RC) stars, as a function of distance using\nRC magnitude as a proxy. These data provide a new global, 3-dimensional view of\nthe Milky Way barred bulge kinematics. We find a gradient in the mean\nlongitudinal proper motion, $<\mu_l^\star>$, between the different sides of the\nbar, which is sensitive to the bar pattern speed. The split RC has distinct\nproper motions and is colder than other stars at similar distance. The proper\nmotion correlation map has a quadrupole pattern in all magnitude slices showing\nno evidence for a separate, more axisymmetric inner bulge component. The\nline-of-sight integrated kinematic maps show a high central velocity dispersion\nsurrounded by a more asymmetric dispersion profile. $\sigma_{\mu_l} /\n\sigma_{\mu_b}$ is smallest, $\sim1.1$, near the minor axis and reaches\n$\sim1.4$ near the disc plane. The integrated $<\mu_b>$ pattern signals a\nsuperposition of bar rotation and internal streaming motion, with the near part\nshrinking in latitude and the far part expanding. To understand and interpret\nthese remarkable data, we compare to a made-to-measure barred dynamical model,\nfolding in the VIRAC selection function to construct mock maps. We find that\nour model of the barred bulge, with a pattern speed of 37.5 $\mathrm{km \,\ns^{-1} \, kpc^{-1}}$, is able to reproduce all observed features impressively\nwell. Dynamical models like this will be key to unlocking the full potential of\nthese data.</td>

Exploiting the relation between Mira pulsation period and stellar\nage/chemistry, we slice the stellar density of the Galactic disk and bulge as a\nfunction of period. We find the morphology of both components evolves as a\nfunction of stellar age/chemistry with the stellar disk being stubby at old\nages, becoming progressively thinner and more radially extended at younger\nstellar ages, consistent with the picture of inside-out and upside-down\nformation of the Milky Way's disk. We see evidence of a perturbed disk, with\nlarge-scale stellar over-densities visible both in and away from the stellar\nplane. We find the bulge is well modelled by a triaxial boxy distribution with\nan axis ratio of $\sim [1:0.4:0.3]$. The oldest of the Miras ($\sim$ 9-10 Gyr)\nshow little bar-like morphology, whilst the younger stars appear inclined at a\nviewing angle of $\sim 21^{\circ}$ to the Sun-Galactic Centre line. This\nsuggests that bar formation and buckling took place 8-9 Gyr ago, with the older\nMiras being hot enough to avoid being trapped by the growing bar. We find the\nyoungest Miras to exhibit a strong peanut morphology, bearing the\ncharacteristic X-shape of an inclined bar structure.</td>

Combining the metallicities and radial\nvelocities from the Pristine and LAMOST surveys and Gaia DR2 parallaxes and\nproper motions for an unprecedented large and unbiased sample of very\nmetal-poor stars at $[Fe/H]\leq-2.5$ we show that this picture is incomplete.\nThis sample shows strong statistical evidence (at the $5.0\sigma$ level) of\nasymmetry in their kinematics, favouring prograde motion. Moreover, we find\nthat $31\%$ of the stars that currently reside in the disk do not venture\noutside of the disk plane throughout their orbit. The discovery of this\npopulation implies that a significant fraction of stars with iron abundances\n$[Fe/H]\leq-2.5$ formed within or concurrently with the Milky Way disk and that\nthe history of the disk was quiet enough to allow them to retain their\ndisk-like orbital properties.</td>

Using data from {\it Gaia} DR2 we study the proper\nmotions, distance, morphology and density of the stream to uncover small scale\nperturbations. The proper motion cleaned data shows a clear distance gradient\nacross the stream, ranging from 7 to 12 kpc. However, unlike earlier studies\nthat found a continuous gradient, we uncover a distance minimum at\n$\varphi_{1}\approx$-50 deg, after which the distance increases again. We can\nreliably trace the stream between -85$<\varphi_{1}<$15 deg, showing an even\nfurther extent to GD-1 beyond the earlier extension of \citet{Price-Whelan18a}.\nWe constrain the stream track and density using a Boolean matched filter\napproach and find three large under densities and find significant residuals in\nthe stream track lining up with these gaps. In particular, a gap is visible at\n$\varphi_{1}$=-3 deg, surrounded by a clear sinusoidal wiggle. We argue that\nthis wiggle is due to a perturbation since it has the wrong orientation to come\nfrom a progenitor. We compute a total initial stellar mass of the stream\nsegment of 1.58$\pm$0.07$\times$10$^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$. With the extended view of\nthe spur in this work, we argue that the spur may be unrelated to the adjacent\ngap in the stream. Finally, we show that an interaction with the Sagittarius\ndwarf can create features similar to the spur.</td>

      <td>We introduce the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopy Survey (${S}^5$), an\non-going program to map the kinematics and chemistry of stellar streams in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. The initial focus of ${S}^5$ has been spectroscopic\nobservations of recently identified streams within the footprint of the Dark\nEnergy Survey (DES), with the eventual goal of surveying streams across the\nentire southern sky. Stellar streams are composed of material that has been\ntidally striped from dwarf galaxies and globular clusters and hence are\nexcellent dynamical probes of the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, as\nwell as providing a detailed snapshot of its accretion history. Observing with\nthe 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope's 2-degree-Field fibre positioner and\nAAOmega spectrograph, and combining the precise photometry of DES DR1 with the\nsuperb proper motions from $Gaia$ DR2, allows us to conduct an efficient\nspectroscopic survey to map these stellar streams. So far ${S}^5$ has mapped 9\nDES streams and 3 streams outside of DES; the former are the first\nspectroscopic observations of these recently discovered streams. In addition to\nthe stream survey, we use spare fibres to undertake a Milky Way halo survey and\na low-redshift galaxy survey. This paper presents an overview of the ${S}^5$\nprogram, describing the scientific motivation for the survey, target selection,\nobservation strategy, data reduction and survey validation. Finally, we\ndescribe early science results on stellar streams and Milky Way halo stars\ndrawn from the survey.

      <td>The GALAH Survey: Chemically tagging the Fimbulthul stream to the globular cluster $Ï$ Centauri</td>
      <td>Using kinematics from Gaia and the large elemental abundance space of the\nsecond data release of the GALAH survey, we identify two new members of the\nFimbulthul stellar stream, and chemically tag them to massive, multi-metallic\nglobular cluster $\omega$ Centauri. Recent analysis of the second data release\nof Gaia had revealed the Fimbulthul stellar stream in the halo of the Milky\nWay. It had been proposed that the stream is associated with the $\omega$\nCentauri, but this proposition relied exclusively upon the kinematics and\nmetallicities of the stars to make the association. In this work, we find our\ntwo new members of the stream to be metal-poor stars that are enhanced in\nsodium and aluminium, typical of second population globular cluster stars, but\nnot otherwise seen in field stars. Furthermore, the stars share the s-process\nabundance pattern seen in $\omega$ Centauri, which is rare in field stars.\nApart from one star within 1.5 deg of $\omega$ Centauri, we find no other stars\nobserved by GALAH spatially near $\omega$ Centauri or the Fimbulthul stream\nthat could be kinematically and chemically linked to the cluster. Chemically\ntagging stars in the Fimbulthul stream to $\omega$ Centauri confirms the\nearlier work, and further links this tidal feature in the Milky Way halo to\n$\omega$ Centauri.</td>

      <td>We perform analysis of the three-dimensional kinematics of Milky Way disk\nstars in mono-age populations. We focus on stars between Galactocentric\ndistances of $R=6$ and 14 \,kpc, selected from the combined LAMOST DR4 red\nclump giant stars and Gaia DR2 proper motion catalogue. We confirm the 3D\nasymmetrical motions of recent works and provide time tagging of the Galactic\nouter disk asymmetrical motions near the anticenter direction out to\nGalactocentric distances of 14\,kpc. Radial Galactocentric motions reach values\nup to 10 km s$^{-1}$, depending on the age of the population, and present a\nnorth-south asymmetry in the region corresponding to density and velocity\nsubstructures that were sensitive to the perturbations in the early 6 \,Gyr.\nAfter that time, the disk stars in this asymmetrical structure have become\nkinematically hotter, and are thus not sensitive to perturbations, and we find\nthe structure is a relatively younger population. With quantitative analysis,\nwe find stars both above and below the plane at $R\gtrsim 9$ kpc that exhibit\nbending mode motions of which the sensitive duration is around 8 \,Gyr. We\nspeculate that the in-plane asymmetries might not be mainly caused by a fast\nrotating bar, intrinsically elliptical outer disk, secular expansion of the\ndisk, or streams. Spiral arm dynamics, out-of-equilibrium models, minor mergers\nor others are important contributors. Vertical motions might be dominated by\nbending and breathing modes induced by complicated inner or external\nperturbers. It is likely that many of these mechanisms are coupled together.</td>

      <td>An outer shade of Pal: Abundance analysis of the outer halo globular cluster Palomar 13</td>
      <td>At a Galactocentric distance of 27 kpc, Pal 13 is an old globular cluster\n(GC) in the outer halo. We present a chemical abundance analysis of this remote\nsystem from high-resolution spectra obtained with Keck/HIRES. Owing to the low\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the data, our analysis is based on a coaddition of the\nspectra of 18 member stars. We are able to determine integrated abundance\nratios for 16 species of 14 elements, of $\alpha$-elements (Mg,Si,Ca,Ti),\nFe-peak (Sc,Mn,Cr,Ni,Cu,and Zn), and n-capture elements (Y,Ba). While the mean\nNa abundance is found to be slightly enhanced and halo-like, our method does\nnot allow us to probe an abundance spread that would be expected in this light\nelement if multiple populations are present in Pal 13. We find a metal-poor\nmean metallicity of $-1.91\pm0.05$ (statistical) $\pm$ 0.22 (systematic),\nconfirming that Pal 13 is a typical metal-poor representative of the outer\nhalo. While there are some differences between individual $\alpha$-elements,\nsuch as halo-like Mg and Si versus the mildly lower Ca and Ti abundances, the\nmean [$\alpha$/Fe] of 0.34$\pm$0.06 is consistent with the marginally lower\n$\alpha$ component of the halo field and GC stars. We discuss our results in\nthe context of other objects in the outer halo and consider which of these\nobjects were likely accreted. We also discuss the properties of their\nprogenitors. While chemically, Pal 13 is similar to Gaia-Enceladus and some of\nits GCs, this is not supported by its kinematic properties. Moreover, its\nchemodynamical similarity with NGC 5466, a progeny of the Sequoia accretion\nevent, might indicate a common origin in this progenitor. However, the\nambiguities in the full abundance space of this comparison emphasize the\ndifficulties in unequivocally labeling a single GC as an accreted object, let\nalone assigning it to a single progenitor.

      <td>Studies of the ages, abundances, and motions of individual stars in the Milky\nWay provide one of the best ways to study the evolution of disk galaxies over\ncosmic time. The formation of the Milky Way's barred inner region in particular\nis a crucial piece of the puzzle of disk galaxy evolution. Using data from\nAPOGEE and Gaia, we present maps of the kinematics, elemental abundances, and\nage of the Milky Way bulge and disk that show the barred structure of the inner\nMilky Way in unprecedented detail. The kinematic maps allow a direct, purely\nkinematic determination of the bar's pattern speed of 41+/-3 km/s/kpc and of\nits shape and radial profile. We find the bar's age, metallicity, and abundance\nratios to be the same as those of the oldest stars in the disk that are formed\nin its turbulent beginnings, while stars in the bulge outside of the bar are\nyounger and more metal-rich. This implies that the bar likely formed ~8 Gyr\nago, when the decrease in turbulence in the gas disk allowed a thin disk to\nform that quickly became bar-unstable. The bar's formation therefore stands as\na crucial epoch in the evolution of the Milky Way, a picture that is in line\nwith the evolutionary path that emerges from observations of the gas kinematics\nin external disk galaxies over the last ~10 Gyr.</td>

MPs\nare detected in five clusters. The fractions of 1G stars, ranging from about\n50% to more than 80%, are significantly higher than those observed in Galactic\nGCs with similar present-day masses. By considering both Galactic and MC\nclusters, the fraction of 1G stars exhibits: (i) a strong anti-correlation with\nthe present-day mass, and (ii) with the present-day mass of 2G stars; (iii) a\nmild anti-correlation with 1G present-day mass. All Galactic clusters without\nMPs have initial masses smaller than ~1.5 10^5 solar masses but a mass\nthreshold governing the occurrence of MPs seems challenged by massive\nsimple-population MC GCs; (iv) Milky Way clusters with large perigalactic\ndistances typically host larger fractions of 1G stars, but the difference\ndisappears when we use initial cluster masses. These facts are consistent with\na scenario where the stars lost by GCs mostly belong to the 1G. By exploiting\nrecent work based on Gaia, half of the known Type II GCs appear clustered in a\ndistinct region of the integral of motions space, thus suggesting a common\nprogenitor galaxy. Except for these Type II GCs,we do not find any significant\ndifference in the MPs between clusters associated with different progenitors.</td>

      <td>We present a newly found wave--like pattern in mean Galactocentric radial\nvelocity U_g vs. guiding centre radius R_g or angular momentum L_z of stars in\nthe RV subsample of Gaia DR2. The short-wave pattern has a wavelength of order\n1.2 kpc in R_g or 285 kpc km/s in L_z. The pattern shows only weak changes with\nGalactocentric radius R and little change in strength in particular with the\nvertical energy E_z of the stars or respectively the distance to the Galactic\nplane |z|. The pattern is to first order symmetric around the plane, i.e. has\nno significant odd terms in z. There is weak phase shift with the pattern\nmoving towards slightly lower L_z (i.e. trailing) with |z| and E_z. However, we\nobserve a highly significant phase shift in Galactic azimuth phi, which is\ndifferent for different peaks. The peak around L_z ~ 2100 kpc km/s only shows a\nweak change with galactic azimuth, while the rest of the pattern shows a\nclearly detectable shift of d L_z /d phi = (200 +/- 22) kpc km/s/rad. If we\nconsider all peaks to belong to the same pattern, this would suggest a\nwavenumber m = 4. We further find that the wave-like pattern in U_g appears to\nbe related to the W vs. L_z pattern detected in Gaia DR1. A comparison of the\nU_g-L_z wave pattern with changes of U_g vs. R, which have been previously\ndiscussed, suggests that the latter can be understood as just the U_g-L_z\npattern washed out by blurring (i.e. orbital excursions around their\nguiding-centre) of disc stars.</td>

The algorithm is trained and tested using the\nSDSS/SEGUE spectroscopic dataset and Gaia photometric/astrometric dataset. At\n[Fe/H]$<-1.2$, the algorithm succeeds in identifying more than 70% of the\ngiants in the training/test set, with a dwarf contamination fraction below 30%\n(with respect to the SDSS/SEGUE dataset). The photometric metallicity estimates\nhave uncertainties better than 0.2 dex when compared with the spectroscopic\nmeasurements. The distances estimated by the algorithm are valid out to a\ndistance of at least $\sim 80$ kpc without requiring any prior on the stellar\ndistribution, and have fully independent uncertainities that take into account\nboth random and systematic errors. These advances allow us to estimate these\nstellar parameters for approximately 12 million stars in the photometric\ndataset. This will enable studies involving the chemical mapping of the distant\nouter disc and the stellar halo, including their kinematics using the Gaia\nproper motions. This type of algorithm can be applied in the Southern\nhemisphere to the first release of LSST data, thus providing an almost complete\nview of the external components of our Galaxy out to at least $\sim 80$ kpc.\nCritical to the success of these efforts will be ensuring well-defined\nspectroscopic training sets that sample a broad range of stellar parameters\nwith minimal biases.

Among those ridges, the\nHercules moving group would then be associated to orbits trapped at the\nco-rotation resonance of the bar. Here we show that a distinctive prediction of\nsuch a model is that the angular momentum of Hercules at the Sun's radius must\nsignificantly decrease with increasing Galactocentric azimuth, i.e. when\ngetting closer to the major axis of the bar. We show that such a dependence of\nthe angular momentum of trapped orbits on the azimuth would on the other hand\nnot happen close to the outer Lindblad resonance of a faster bar, unless the\norbital distribution is still far from phase-mixed, namely for a bar\nperturbation younger than ~ 2 Gyr. Using Gaia DR2 and Bayesian distances from\nthe StarHorse code, and tracing the average Galactocentric radial velocity as a\nfunction of angular momentum and azimuth, we show that the Hercules angular\nmomentum changes significantly with azimuth as expected for the co-rotation\nresonance of a dynamically old large bar.</td>

Our method is\ntested and calibrated using Galaxia and N-body models. We find a total\nluminosity (out to 100 kpc) of L_halo = 7.9 +/- 2.0 x 10^8 L_Sun excluding Sgr,\nand L_halo = 9.4 +/- 2.4 x 10^8 L_Sun including Sgr.

Assuming a stellar mass-to-light ratio appropriate\nfor a Kroupa initial mass function (M*/L = 1.5), we estimate a stellar halo\nmass of M*_halo = 1.4 +/- 0.4 x 10^9 M_Sun. This mass is larger than previous\nestimates in the literature, but is in good agreement with the emerging picture\nthat the (inner) stellar halo is dominated by one massive dwarf progenitor.\nFinally, we argue that the combination of a ~10^9 M_Sun mass and an average\nmetallicity of <[Fe/H]> ~ -1.5 for the Galactic halo points to an ancient (~10\nGyr) merger event.</td>

      <td>Multiple retrograde substructures in the Galactic halo: A shattered view of Galactic history</td>
      <td>Aims. Several kinematic and chemical substructures have been recently found\namongst Milky Way halo stars with retrograde motions. It is currently unclear\nhow these various structures are related to each other. This Letter aims to\nshed light on this issue. Methods. We explore the retrograde halo with an\naugmented version of the Gaia DR2 RVS sample, extended with data from three\nlarge spectroscopic surveys, namely RAVE, APOGEE and LAMOST. In this dataset,\nwe identify several structures using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm. We\ndiscuss their properties and possible links using all the available chemical\nand dynamical information. Results. In concordance with previous work, we find\nthat stars with [Fe/H] $<-1$ have more retrograde motions than those with\n[Fe/H] $>-1$. The retrograde halo contains a mixture of debris from objects\nlike Gaia-Enceladus, Sequoia, and even the chemically defined thick-disc. We\nfind that the Sequoia has a smaller range in orbital energies than previously\nsuggested and is confined to high-energy. Sequoia could be a small galaxy in\nitself, but since it overlaps both in integrals-of-motion space and chemical\nabundance space with the less bound debris of Gaia-Enceladus, its nature cannot\nbe fully settled yet. In the low-energy part of the halo we find evidence for\nat least one more distinct structure: Thamnos. Stars in Thamnos are on low\ninclination, mildly eccentric retrograde orbits, moving at\n$v_{\phi}\approx-150$ km/s, and are chemically distinct from the other\nstructures. Conclusions. Even with the excellent Gaia DR2 data it remains\nchallenging to piece together all the fragments found in the retrograde halo.\nAt this point, we are very much in need of large datasets with high-quality\nhigh-resolution spectra and tailored high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations\nof galaxy mergers.</td>

Based on the similarities in distance, proper motions, inferred\ncolor-magnitude distribution, and trajectory, we identify this stream as the\ntrailing tidal tail of M5. While the surface density of stars is very low (~1.5\nstars per square degree, or approximately 35 magnitudes per square arcsecond),\nselecting only stars having proper motions consistent with the orbit of the\ncluster yield a detection significance ~10 sigma. While we find a possible\ncontinuation of the stream to ~85 degrees, increasing foreground contamination\ncombined with a greater predicted stream distance make it difficult to detect\nwith current data even if the stream continues unabated. The non-uniform\ndistribution of stars in the stream appears to be consistent with episodic\ntidal stripping, with the most recently shed stars now trailing the cluster by\ntens of degrees.

      <td>Mapping the Galactic disk with the LAMOST and Gaia Red clump sample: III: A new velocity substructure and time stamps of the Galactic disk asymmetry in the disk between 12$-$15 \,kpc</td>
      <td>We investigate the three-dimensional asymmetrical kinematics and present time\nstamps of the Milky Way disk between Galactocentric distances of $R=12$ and 15\n\,kpc, using red clump stars selected from the LAMOST Galactic survey, also\nwith proper motion measurements provided by the Gaia DR2. We discover velocity\nsubstructure above the Galactic plane corresponding to a density dip found\nrecently ("south-middle opposite" density structure[R $\sim$ 12-15 \,kpc, Z\n$\sim$ 1.5 \,kpc] discovered in \citet{Wang2018b, Wang2018c}) in the radial and\nazimuthal velocity. For the vertical velocity, we detect clear vertical bulk\nmotions or bending mode motions, which has no clear north-south asymmetry\ncorresponding to the in-plane asymmetrical features. In the subsample of stars\nwith different ages, we find that there is little temporal evolution of the\nin-plane asymmetry from 0$-$14 \,Gyr, which means the structure is sensitive to\nthe perturbations in almost cosmic time possibly. We propose that the possible\nscenario of this asymmetric velocity structure is caused by the mechanisms\ngenerated in-plane, rather than vertical perturbations.</td>

      <td>Disentangling the Arcturus stream</td>
      <td>The Arcturus stream is an over-density of stars in velocity space and its\norigin has been much debated recently without any clear conclusion. Resolving\nthe nature of the Arcturus stream can provide clues to the formation history of\nthe Milky Way and its stellar populations. The space velocities, angular\nmomenta and actions for a sample of more than 5.8 million stars, composed from\nGaia DR2, are analysed with a wavelet transform. The kinematic characteristics\nof each identified group is used to select possible members of the groups from\nthe GALAH and APOGEE spectroscopic surveys to further study and constrain their\nchemical properties. In the velocity and angular momentum spaces the already\nknown Sirius, Pleiades, Hyades, Hercules, AF06, Arcturus and KFR08 streams are\nclearly identified. The Hercules stream appears to be a mixture of thin and\nthick disk stars. The Arcturus stream, as well as the AF06 and KFR08 streams,\nare low-velocity and low-angular momentum structures with chemical compositions\nsimilar to the thick disk. These three groups extend further from the Galactic\nplane compared to the Hercules stream. The detections of all the groups were\nspaced by approximately 20-30 km/s in azimuthal velocity. A wide spread of\nchemical abundances within the Arcturus stream indicates that the group is not\na dissolved open cluster. Instead the Arcturus stream, together with the AF06\nand KFR08 streams, are more likely to be part of a phase-space wave, that could\nhave been caused by an ancient merger event. This conclusion is based on that\nthe different structures are detected in steps of 20-30 km/s in azimuthal\nvelocity, that the kinematic and chemical features are different from what is\nexpected for bar-originated structures, and that the lower-velocity streams\nextend further from the disk than bar-originated structures.</td>

      <td>Using a large sample of bright nearby stars with accurate Gaia Data Release 2\nastrometry and auxiliary spectroscopy we map out the properties of the\nprinciple Galactic components such as the "thin" and "thick" discs and the\nhalo. We show that in the Solar neighborhood, there exists a large population\nof metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-0.7) stars on highly eccentric orbits. By studying the\nevolution of elemental abundances, kinematics and stellar ages in the plane of\nazimuthal velocity v_phi and metallicity [Fe/H], we demonstrate that this\nmetal-rich halo-like component, which we dub the Splash, is linked to the\nalpha-rich (or "thick") disc. Splash stars have little to no angular momentum\nand many are on retrograde orbits. They are predominantly old, but not as old\nas the stars deposited into the Milky Way in the last major merger. We argue,\nin agreement with several recent studies, that the Splash stars may have been\nborn in the Milky Way's proto-disc prior to the massive ancient accretion event\nwhich drastically altered their orbits. We can not, however, rule out other\n(alternative) formation channels. Taking advantage of the causal connection\nbetween the merger and the Splash, we put constraints of the epoch of the last\nmassive accretion event to have finished 9.5 Gyr ago. The link between the\nlocal metal-rich and metal-poor retrograde stars is confirmed using a large\nsuite of cutting-edge numerical simulations of the Milky Way's formation.</td>

It is likely\nthat the globular cluster system of our Galaxy has followed a similarly\nintricate formation path. $Aims$. To constrain this formation path, we explore\nthe link between the globular clusters and the known merging events that the\nMilky Way has experienced. $Methods$. To this end, we combined the kinematic\ninformation provided by $Gaia$ for almost all Galactic clusters, with the\nlargest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for\nsystematic errors. To identify clusters with a common origin we analysed their\ndynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion.\n$Results$. We find that about 40% of the clusters likely formed in situ. A\nsimilarly large fraction, 35%, appear to be possibly associated to known merger\nevents, in particular to $Gaia$-Enceladus (19%), the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy\n(5%), the progenitor of the Helmi streams (6%), and to the Sequoia galaxy (5%),\nalthough some uncertainty remains due to the degree of overlap in their\ndynamical characteristics. Of the remaining clusters, 16% are tentatively\nassociated to a group with high binding energy, while the rest are all on\nloosely bound orbits and likely have a more heterogeneous origin. The resulting\nage-metallicity relations are remarkably tight and differ in their detailed\nproperties depending on the progenitor, providing further confidence on the\nassociations made. $Conclusions$. We provide a table listing the likely\nassociations. Improved kinematic data by future Gaia data releases and\nespecially a larger, systematic error-free sample of cluster ages would help to\nfurther solidify our conclusions.</td>

      <td>Previous studies based on the analysis of Gaia DR2 data have revealed that\naccreted stars, possibly originating from a single progenitor satellite, are a\nsignificant component of the halo of our Galaxy, potentially constituting most\nof the halo stars at $\rm [Fe/H] < -1$ within a few kpc from the Sun and\nbeyond. In this paper, we couple astrometric data from Gaia DR2 with elemental\nabundances from APOGEE DR14 to characterize the kinematics and chemistry of\nin-situ and accreted populations up to $\rm [Fe/H] \sim -2$. Accreted stars\nappear to significantly impact the Galactic chemo-kinematic relations, not only\nat $\rm [Fe/H] < -1$, but also at metallicities typical of the thick and\nmetal-poor thin discs. They constitute about 60% of all stars at $\rm [Fe/H] <\n-1$, the remaining 40% being made of (metal-weak) thick disc stars. We find\nthat the stellar kinematic fossil record shows the imprint left by this\naccretion event which heated the old Galactic disc. We are able to age-date\nthis kinematic imprint, showing that the accretion occurred between 9 and 11\nGyr ago, and that it led to the last significant heating of the Galactic disc.\nAn important fraction of stars with abundances typical of the (metal-rich)\nthick disc, and heated by this interaction, is now found in the Galactic halo.\nIndeed about half of the kinematically defined halo at few kpc from the Sun is\ncomposed of metal-rich thick disc stars. Moreover, we suggest that this\nmetal-rich thick disc component dominates the stellar halo of the inner Galaxy.\nThe new picture that emerges from this study is one where the standard\nnon-rotating in-situ halo population, the collapsed halo, seems to be more\nelusive than ever.</td>

      <td>The little things matter: relating the abundance of ultrafaint satellites to the hosts' assembly history</td>
      <td>Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies ($M_\star\lesssim10^{5-6}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) are\nrelics of an early phase of galaxy formation. They contain some of the oldest\nand most metal-poor stars in the Universe which likely formed before the epoch\nof hydrogen reionisation. These galaxies are so faint that they can only be\ndetected as satellites of the Milky Way. They are so small that they are just\nbarely resolved in current cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. Here we\ncombine very high resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations with a\nsemi-analytic model of galaxy formation to study the demographics and spatial\ndistribution of ultrafaint satellites in Milky Way-mass haloes. We show that\nthe abundance of these galaxies is correlated with the assembly history of the\nhost halo: at fixed mass, haloes assembled earlier contain, on average, more\nultrafaint satellites today than haloes assembled later. We identify simulated\ngalactic haloes that experience an ancient Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage-like and a\nrecent LMC-like accretion event and find that the former occurs in 33% of the\nsample and the latter in 9%. Only 3% experience both events and these are\nespecially rich in ultrafaint satellites, most acquired during the ancient\naccretion event. Our models predict that the radial distribution of satellites\nis more centrally concentrated in early-forming haloes. Accounting for the\ndepletion of satellites by tidal interactions with the central disc, we find a\nvery good match to the observed radial distribution of satellites in the Milky\nWay over the entire radial range. This agreement is mainly due to the ability\nof our model to track 'orphan' galaxies after their subhaloes fall below the\nresolution limit of the simulation.</td>

We found 259 objects possibly associated with the\ncluster lying in the vicinity of the giant branch and 1--2 magnitudes\nfainter/brighter than the main-sequence turn-off in the cluster color-magnitude\ndiagram and which cover an area on the sky of $\sim$4.1 deg$^{2}$ centered on\nthe cluster. We traced back the orbit of NGC 6362 in a realistic Milky-Way\npotential, using the \texttt{GravPot16} package, for 3 Gyrs. The orbit shows\nthat the cluster shares similar orbital properties as the inner disk, having\nperi-/apo-galactic distances, and maximum vertical excursion from the Galactic\nplane inside the corotation radius (CR), moving inwards from CR radius to visit\nthe inner regions of the Milky Way. The dynamical history of the cluster\nreveals that it has crossed the Galactic disk several times in its lifetime and\nhas recently undergone a gravitational shock, $\sim 15.9$ Myr ago, suggesting\nthat less than 0.1\% of its mass has been lost during the current disk-shocking\nevent. Based on the cluster's orbit and position in the Galaxy, we conclude\nthat the possible extended star debris candidates are a combined effect of the\nshocks from the Galactic disk and evaporation from the cluster. Lastly, the\nevolution of the vertical component of the angular momentum shows that the\ncluster is strongly affected dynamically by the Galactic bar potential.</td>

      <td>Analysis of the disc components of our Galaxy via kinematic and spectroscopic procedures</td>

With the kinematical procedure, we\ninvestigated the distribution of the [$\alpha$/Fe] abundances into the high/low\nprobability thin disc, and high/low probability thick-disc populations in terms\nof total space velocity, [Fe/H] abundance, and age. The high probability\nthin-disc stars dominate in all sub-intervals of [$\alpha$/Fe], including the\nrich ones: [$\alpha$/Fe]$>0.3$ dex, where the high probability thick-disc stars\nare expected to dominate. This result can be explained by the limiting apparent\nmagnitude of the GALAH DR2 ($V<14$ mag) and intermediate Galactic latitude of\nthe star sample. Stars in the four populations share equivalent [$\alpha$/Fe]\nand [Fe/H] abundances, total space velocities and ages. Hence, none of these\nparameters can be used alone for separation of a sample of stars into different\npopulations. High probability thin-disc stars with abundance\n$-1.3<{\rm[Fe/H]}\leq -0.5$ dex and age $9<\tau\leq13$ Gyr are assumed to have\ndifferent birth places relative to the metal rich and younger ones. With the\nspectroscopic procedure, we separated the sample stars into $\alpha$-rich and\n$\alpha$-poor categories by means of their ages as well as their [$\alpha$/Fe]\nand [Fe/H] abundances. Stars older than 8 Gyr are richer in [$\alpha$/Fe] than\nthe younger ones. We could estimate the abundance [$\alpha$/Fe]=0.14 dex as the\nboundery separating the $\alpha$-rich and $\alpha$-poor sub-samples in the\n[$\alpha$/Fe]$\times$[Fe/H] plane.</td>

The Pal 5 globular cluster and its associated tails are an excellent\ncandidate for such analysis; however, only ~23 degrees of arc are currently\nknown, with in particular the leading tail much shorter than the trailing.\nUsing Gaia DR2 and its precise astrometry, we extend the known extent of the\nPal 5 tail to ~30 degrees, 7 degrees of which are newly detected along the\nleading arm. The detected leading and trailing arms are symmetric in length and\nremain near constant width. This detection constrains proposed models in which\nthe Galactic bar truncates Pal 5's leading arm. Follow-up spectroscopic\nobservations are necessary to verify the candidate stream stars are consistent\nwith the known tidal tails.

In\nthe case of the homogeneous slab, we compare the DMD modes to the analytic\nnormal modes of the system to evaluate the feasibility of DMD in collisionless\nself gravitating systems. This is followed by the isothermal plane model, where\nwe focus on the effect of self gravity on phase mixing. We compute DMD modes of\nthe system for varying relative dominance of mutual interaction and external\npotential, so as to study the corresponding variance in mode structure and\nlifetime. We find that there is a regime of relative dominance, at\napproximately $ 4:1 $ external potential to mutual interaction where the DMD\nmodes are spirals in the $ (z,v_z) $ plane, and are nearly un-damped. This\nleads to the proposition that a system undergoing phase mixing in the presence\nof weak to moderate self gravity can have persisting spiral structure in the\nform of such modes. We then conclude with the conjecture that such a mechanism\nmay be at work in the phase space spirals observed in Gaia Data Release 2, and\nthat studying more complex simulations with DMD may aid in understanding both\nthe timing and form of the perturbation that lead to the observed spirals.</td>

      <td>The Galactic stellar halo is predicted to have formed at least partially from\nthe tidal disruption of accreted dwarf galaxies. This assembly history should\nbe detectable in the orbital and chemical properties of stars. The H3 Survey is\nobtaining spectra for 200,000 stars, and, when combined with Gaia data, is\nproviding detailed orbital and chemical properties of Galactic halo stars.\nUnlike previous surveys of the halo, the H3 target selection is based solely on\nmagnitude and Gaia parallax; the survey therefore provides a nearly unbiased\nview of the entire stellar halo at high latitudes. In this paper we present the\ndistribution of stellar metallicities as a function of Galactocentric distance\nand orbital properties for a sample of 4232 kinematically-selected halo giants\nto 100 kpc. The stellar halo is relatively metal-rich, [Fe/H]=-1.2, and there\nis no discernable metallicity gradient over the range $6<R_{\rm gal}<100$ kpc.\nHowever, the halo metallicity distribution is highly structured including\ndistinct metal-rich and metal-poor components at $R_{\rm gal}<10$ kpc and\n$R_{\rm gal}>30$ kpc, respectively. Metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]$<-2$ are a\nsmall population of the halo at all distances and orbital categories. We\nassociate the "in-situ" stellar halo with stars displaying thick-disk chemistry\non halo-like orbits; such stars are confined to $|z|<10$ kpc. The majority of\nthe stellar halo is resolved into discrete features in orbital-chemical space,\nsuggesting that the bulk of the stellar halo formed from the accretion and\ntidal disruption of dwarf galaxies.

In cylindrical Galactic\ncoordinates $(R,\phi,z)$, ridge-like structures can be seen in the \vphiR{}\nplane and asymmetric arch-like structures in the \vphivR{} plane. We show that\nthe ridges are also clearly present when the third dimension of the \vphiR{}\nplane is represented by $\langle z \rangle$, $\langle V_z \rangle$, $\langle\nV_R \rangle$, $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ and $\langle[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]\rangle$.\nThe maps suggest that stars along the ridges lie preferentially close to the\nGalactic midplane ($|z|<0.2$ kpc), and have metallicity and $\alpha$ elemental\nabundance similar to that of the Sun. We show that phase mixing of disrupting\nspiral arms can generate both the ridges and the arches. It also generates\ndiscrete groupings in orbital energy $-$ the ridges and arches are simply\nsurfaces of constant energy. We identify 8 distinct ridges in the \gaia{} data:\nsix of them have constant energy while two have constant angular momentum.\nGiven that the signature is strongest for stars close to the plane, the\npresence of ridges in $\langle z \rangle$ and $\langle V_z \rangle$ suggests a\ncoupling between planar and vertical directions. We demonstrate, using N-body\nsimulations that such coupling can be generated both in isolated discs and in\ndiscs perturbed by an orbiting satellite like the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.</td>

Within a decade, precise measurements of such properties will be\navailable for hundreds of millions of stars. Meanwhile, time-domain surveys\ninitiated with CoRoT and Kepler/K2 and carried on by space missions such as\nTESS and PLATO or ground-based projects like the LSST, will have brought\nasteroseismology to a high level of maturity. The combination of precise ages\nfrom asteroseismology with astrometric and spectroscopic data, on large stellar\nsamples, is allowing Galactic archaeologists to gain new insight into the\nassembly history of the Milky Way. Recent breakthroughs --- based on the\ndetection of solar-like oscillations in tens of thousands of red-giant stars\n--- demonstrate the potential of such approach. Therefore, we are convinced\nthat an all-sky, high-cadence, long-duration stellar variability survey will\nbecome a scientific priority in the 2035-50 period. The Chronos concept\npresented here consists in a time-domain extension to Gaia. It will allow for\nmass and age estimates for half a million red giants within 1.7 kpc from the\nSun and hence shed a new light on our understanding of the Galactic dynamics\nand archaeology. In terms of the targeted pulsators, Chronos will bridge the\ngap between PLATO and the LSST by surveying stars all the way from the subgiant\nbranch to the early AGB. Finally, it will surpass all previous surveys capable\nof conducting asteroseismology in terms of the combined sky coverage and\nduration of the observations (2 x 3.75 months over the whole sky and >5 years\nin the CVZ).</td>

      <td>Hypervelocity stars from star clusters hosting Intermediate-Mass Black Holes</td>
      <td>Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) represent a unique population of stars in the\nGalaxy reflecting properties of the whole Galactic potential. Determining their\norigin is of fundamental importance to constrain the shape and mass of the dark\nhalo. The leading scenario for the ejection of HVSs is an encounter with the\nsupermassive black hole in the Galactic Centre. However, new proper motions\nfrom the \textit{Gaia} mission indicate that only the fastest HVSs can be\ntraced back to the Galactic centre and the remaining stars originate in the\ndisc or halo. In this paper, we study HVSs generated by encounters of stellar\nbinaries with an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a star\ncluster. For the first time, we model the effect of the cluster orbit in the\nGalactic potential on the observable properties of the ejected population. HVSs\ngenerated by this mechanism do not travel on radial orbits consistent with a\nGalactic centre origin, but rather point back to their parent cluster, thus\nproviding observational evidence for the presence of an IMBH. We also model the\nejection of high-velocity stars from the Galactic population of globular\nclusters, assuming that they all contain an IMBH, including the effects of the\ncluster's orbit and propagation of the star in the Galactic potential up to\ndetection. We find that high-velocity stars ejected by IMBHs have distinctive\ndistributions in velocity, Galactocentric distance and Galactic latitude, which\ncan be used to distinguish them from runaway stars and stars ejected from the\nGalactic Centre.</td>

      <td>Kinematics with Gaia DR2: The Force of a Dwarf</td>
      <td>We use Gaia DR2 astrometric and line-of-sight velocity information combined\nwith two sets of distances obtained with a Bayesian inference method to study\nthe 3D velocity distribution in the Milky Way disc. We search for variations in\nall Galactocentric cylindrical velocity components ($V_{\phi}$, $V_R$ and\n$V_z$) with Galactic radius, azimuth, and distance from the disc mid-plane. We\nconfirm recent work showing that bulk vertical motions in the $R\text{-}z$\nplane are consistent with a combination of breathing and bending modes. In the\n$x\text{-}y$ plane, we show that, although the amplitudes change, the structure\nproduced by these modes is mostly invariant as a function of distance from the\nplane. Comparing to two different Galactic disc models, we demonstrate that the\nobserved patterns can drastically change in short time intervals, showing the\ncomplexity of understanding the origin of vertical perturbations. A strong\nradial $V_R$ gradient was identified in the inner disc, transitioning smoothly\nfrom $16$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ at an azimuth of $30^\circ<\phi<45^\circ$\nahead of the Sun-Galactic centre line, to $-16$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ at an\nazimuth of $-45^\circ<\phi<-30^\circ$ lagging the solar azimuth. We use a\nsimulation with no significant recent mergers to show that exactly the opposite\ntrend is expected from a barred potential, but overestimated distances can flip\nthis trend to match the data. Alternatively, using an $N$-body simulation of\nthe Sagittarius dwarf-Milky Way interaction, we demonstrate that a major recent\nperturbation is necessary to reproduce the observations. Such an impact may\nhave strongly perturbed the existing bar or even triggered its formation in the\nlast $1\text{-}2$ Gyr.</td>

      <td>Gaia DR2 provides an unprecedented sample of stars with full 6D phase-space\nmeasurements, creating the need for a self-consistent means of discovering and\ncharacterising the phase-space overdensities known as moving groups or\nassociations. Here we present Chronostar, a new Bayesian analysis tool that\nmeets this need. Chronostar uses the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm to\nremove the circular dependency between association membership lists and fits to\ntheir phase-space distributions, making it possible to discover unknown\nassociations within a kinematic data set. It uses forward-modelling of orbits\nthrough the Galactic potential to overcome the problem of tracing backward\nstars whose kinematics have significant observational errors, thereby providing\nreliable ages. In tests using synthetic data sets with realistic measurement\nerrors and complex initial distributions, Chronostar successfully recovers\nmembership assignments and kinematic ages up to ~ 100 Myr. In tests on real\nstellar kinematic data in the phase-space vicinity of the ${\beta}$ Pictoris\nMoving Group, Chronostar successfully rediscovers the association without any\nhuman intervention, identifies 15 new likely members, corroborates 43 candidate\nmembers, and returns a kinematic age of 17.8+-1.2 Myr. In the process we also\nrediscover the Tucana-Horologium Moving Group, for which we obtain a kinematic\nage of 36.3+1.3-1.4 Myr.</td>

      <td>The Implications of Local Fluctuations in the Galactic Midplane for Dynamical Analysis in the Gaia Era</td>
      <td>Orbital properties of stars, computed from their six-dimensional phase space\nmeasurements and an assumed Galactic potential, are used to understand the\nstructure and evolution of the Galaxy. Stellar actions, computed from orbits,\nhave the attractive quality of being invariant under certain assumptions and\nare therefore used as quantitative labels of a star's orbit. We report a subtle\nbut important systematic error that is induced in the actions as a consequence\nof local midplane variations expected for the Milky Way. This error is\ndifficult to model because it is non-Gaussian and bimodal, with neither mode\npeaking on the null value. An offset in the vertical position of the Galactic\nmidplane of $\sim15\,\text{pc}$ for a thin disk-like orbit or $\sim\n120\,\text{pc}$ for a thick disk-like orbit induces a $25\%$ systematic error\nin the vertical action $J_z$. In FIRE simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies,\nthese variations are on the order of $\sim100\,\text{pc}$ at the solar circle.\nFrom observations of the mean vertical velocity variation of\n$\sim5\text{--}10\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ with radius, we estimate that the\nMilky Way midplane variations are $\sim60\text{--}170\,\text{pc}$, consistent\nwith three-dimensional dust maps. Action calculations and orbit integrations,\nwhich assume the global and local midplanes are identical, are likely to\ninclude this induced error, depending on the volume considered. Variation in\nthe local standard of rest or distance to the Galactic center causes similar\nissues. The variation of the midplane must be taken into account when\nperforming dynamical analysis across the large regions of the disk accessible\nto Gaia and future missions.</td>

      <td>Gaia Parallax of Milky Way Globular Clusters -- A Solution of Mixture Model</td>
      <td>We have established a mixture model approach to derive the parallax of the\nMilky Way globular clusters. It avoids the problem of cluster membership\ndetermination and provides a completely independent astrometrical solution by\npurely using the parallax data. This method is validated with simulated\nclusters of \cite{2017MNRAS.467..412P}. We have resolved 120 real globular\nclusters by the mixture model using parallaxes of the second data release of\n\gaia. They construct the largest direct parallax sample up to now. In\ncomparing with other direct parallax results based on cluster members,\nincluding 75 clusters of \cite{2018A&A...616A..12G}, our method presents its\naccuracy, especially for some particular clusters. A systematic offset of\n$-27.6\pm1.7$ $\mu$as, together with a scatter of $22.8\pm1.3$ $\mu$as is found\nin comparing with other indirect parallax measurements. They are consistent\nwith the global value and the variation of the zero-point of current \gaia\nparallaxes. Distances of several specific nearby globular clusters are\ndiscussed while the closest ones can reach high precisions, even taking the\nsystematic error into account.</td>

      <td>The tilt of the velocity ellipsoid in the Milky Way with Gaia DR2</td>
      <td>The velocity distribution of stars is a sensitive probe of the gravitational\npotential of the Galaxy, and hence of its dark matter distribution. In\nparticular, the shape of the dark halo (e.g. spherical, oblate, or prolate)\ndetermines velocity correlations, and different halo geometries are expected to\nresult in measurable differences. Here we explore and interpret the\ncorrelations in the $(v_R, v_z)$-velocity distribution as a function of\nposition in the Milky Way. We selected a high-quality sample of stars from the\nGaia DR2 catalogue and characterised the orientation of the velocity\ndistribution or tilt angle over a radial distance range of $[4-13]~$kpc and up\nto $3.5~$kpc away from the Galactic plane while taking into account the effects\nof the measurement errors. We find that the tilt angles change from spherical\nalignment in the inner Galaxy ($R\sim4~$kpc) towards more cylindrical\nalignments in the outer Galaxy ($R\sim11~$kpc) when using distances that take a\nglobal zero-point offset in the parallax of $-29~\mu$as. However, if the\namplitude of this offset is underestimated, then the inferred tilt angles in\nthe outer Galaxy only appear shallower and are intrinsically more consistent\nwith spherical alignment for an offset as large as $-54~\mu$as. We further find\nthat the tilt angles do not seem to strongly vary with Galactic azimuth and\nthat different stellar populations depict similar tilt angles. Therefore we\nintroduce a simple analytic function that describes the trends found over the\nfull radial range. Since the systematic parallax errors in Gaia DR2 depend on\ncelestial position, magnitude, and colour in complex ways, it is not possible\nto fully correct for them. Therefore it will be particularly important for\ndynamical modelling of the Milky Way to thoroughly characterise the systematics\nin astrometry in future Gaia data releases.</td>

Based on 10,000 red giant branch (RGB) stars (out of 75,000 with high\nvelocity), we find that the two sequences have different metallicity\ndistribution functions; one peaks at $-1.4$ dex (blue sequence) and the other\nat $-0.7$ dex (red sequence). Isochrones with ages in the range $11$-$13.5$\nGyr, and metallicities chosen to match the observations for each sequence, fit\nthe turnoffs and broad RGBs well, indicating that the two populations formed at\ncomparable times within the uncertainties. We find that the mean tangential\nvelocity of disk stars increases steadily with decreasing metallicity, and that\nthe red sequence is made up of the high-velocity stars at the lowest\nmetallicities of the thick-disk population. Using relative number densities, we\nfurther find that the red-sequence stars are more centrally concentrated in the\nGalaxy, and we estimate the radial scale length of this population to be on the\norder of $2$-$3$ kpc. The blue-sequence stars, on the other hand, follow a\nnearly flat radial density profile. These findings tighten the link between the\nred-sequence stars and the chemically defined thick disk.</td>

We applied a kernel density estimation to the $UV$\nvelocity space of white dwarfs. For the region where a clear overdensity of\nstars was found, we created a 5-D space of dynamic variables. We applied a\nhierarchichal clustering method, HDBSCAN, to this 5-D space, identifying those\nwhite dwarfs that share similar kinematic characteristics. Finally, under\ngeneral assumptions and from their photometric properties, we derived an age\nestimate for each object. The Hercules stream was firstly revealed as an\noverdensity in the $UV$ velocity space of the thick-disk white dwarf\npopulation. Three substreams were then found: Hercules $a$ and Hercules $b$,\nformed by thick-disk stars with an age distribution peaked $4\,$Gyr in the past\nand extended to very old ages; and Hercules $c$, with a ratio of 65:35\nthin:thick stars and a more uniform age distribution younger than 10 Gyr.</td>

Using Gaia DR2 distance estimates, it is now possible to estimate stellar\nages for a larger volume of evolved stars through isochrone matching. This work\npresents [M/H]-age and [$\alpha$/M]-age relations derived for different spatial\nlocations in the Milky Way disc. These relations are derived by hierarchically\nmodelling the star formation history of stars within a given chemical abundance\nbin. For the first time, we directly observe that significant variation is\napparent in the [M/H]-age relation as a function of both Galactocentric radius\nand distance from the disc mid-plane. The [M/H]-age relations support claims\nthat radial migration has a significant effect in the plane of the disc. Using\nthe [M/H] bin with the youngest mean age at each radial zone in the plane of\nthe disc, the present-day metallicity gradient is measured to be $-0.059 \pm\n0.010$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, in agreement with Cepheids and young field stars. We\nfind a vertically flared distribution of young stars in the outer disc,\nconfirming predictions of models and previous observations. The mean age of the\n[M/H]-[$\alpha$/M] distribution of the solar neighborhood suggests that the\nhigh-[M/H] stars are not an evolutionary extension of the low-$\alpha$\nsequence.

We also included similar\nestimates available in the literature ending up with the largest and most\nhomogeneous spectroscopic data set ever collected for RRLs (2,903). The\nmetallicity scale was validated by using iron abundances based on high\nresolution spectra for a fundamental field RRL (V~Ind), for which we collected\nX-shooter spectra covering the entire pulsation cycle. The peak\n([Fe/H]=-1.59$\pm$0.01) and the standard deviation ($\sigma$=0.43 dex) of the\nmetallicity distribution agree quite well with similar estimates available in\nthe literature. The current measurements disclose a well defined metal-rich\ntail approaching Solar iron abundance. The spectroscopic sample plotted in the\nBailey diagram (period vs luminosity amplitude) shows a steady variation when\nmoving from the metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-3.0/-2.5) to the metal-rich\n([Fe/H]=-0.5/0.0) regime. The smooth transition in the peak of the period\ndistribution as a function of the metallicity strongly indicates that the\nlong-standing problem of the Oosterhoff dichotomy among Galactic globulars is\nthe consequence of the lack of metal-intermediate clusters hosting RRLs. We\nalso found that the luminosity amplitude, in contrast with period, does not\nshow a solid correlation with metallicity. This suggests that\nperiod-amplitude-metallicity relations should be cautiously treated.</td>

We apply our method to the\nproper motion data from a combination of Gaia DR2 and VISTA Variables in the\nVia Lactea (VVV) to measure the pattern speed of the bar as\n$\Omega_\mathrm{p}=(41\pm 3)\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}}$ (where the error\nis statistical). This puts the corotation radius at\n$(5.7\pm0.4)\,\mathrm{kpc}$, under the assumptions of the standard peculiar\nmotion of the Sun and the absence of non-axisymmetric streaming in the Solar\nneighbourhood. The obtained result uses only data on the near-side of the bar\nwhich produces consistent measurements of the distance and velocity of the\ncentre of the Galaxy. Addition of the data on the far-side of the bar pulls the\npattern speed down to $\Omega_\mathrm{p}=(31\pm\n1)\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}}$ but requires a lower transverse velocity for\nthe Galactic centre than observed. This suggests systematics of\n$5-10\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}kpc^{-1}}$ dominate the uncertainty.

In addition to statistical\nmeasurement errors, there are significant spatially correlated systematic\nerrors, which cannot be ignored when studying the internal kinematics. We\ndevelop a mathematically consistent procedure for incorporating the spatial\ncorrelations in any model-fitting approach, and use it to determine rotation\nand velocity dispersion profiles of a few dozen clusters. We confirm detection\nof rotation in the sky plane for ~10 clusters reported in previous studies, and\ndiscover a few more clusters with rotation amplitudes exceeding ~0.05 mas/yr.\nHowever, in more than half of these cases the significance of this rotation\nsignature is rather low when taking into account the systematic errors. We find\nthat the PM dispersion is not sensitive to systematic errors in PM, however, it\nis quite sensitive to the selection criteria on the input sample, most\nimportantly, in crowded central regions. When using the cleanest possible\nsamples, PM dispersion can be reliably measured down to 0.1 mas/yr for ~60\nclusters.</td>

      <td>Not Gone with the Wind: Planet Occurrence is Independent of Stellar Galactocentric Velocity</td>
      <td>We demonstrate that planet occurrence does not depend on stellar\ngalactocentric velocity in the Solar neighborhood. Using Gaia DR2 astrometry\nand radial velocity data, we calculate 3D galactocentric velocities for 197,090\nKepler field stars, 1647 of which are confirmed planet hosts. When we compare\nthe galactocentric velocities of planet hosts to those of the entire field star\nsample, we observe a statistically significant (KS p-value = $10^{-70}$)\ndistinction, with planet hosts being apparently slower than field stars by\n$\sim$40 km/s. We explore some potential explanations for this difference and\nconclude that it is not a consequence of the planet-metallicity relation or\ndistinctions in the samples' thin/thick disk membership, but rather an artefact\nof Kepler's selection function. Non Kepler-host stars that have nearly\nidentical distances, temperatures, surface gravities, and Kepler magnitudes to\nthe confirmed planet hosts also have nearly identical velocity distributions.\nUsing one of these identical non-host samples, we consider that the probability\nof a star with velocity $v_{\mathrm{tot}}$ hosting a planet can be described by\nan exponential function proportional to $e^{(-v_{\mathrm{tot}}/v_0)}$. Using a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo sampler, we determine that $v_0 > $976 km/s to 99%\nconfidence, which implies that planets in the Solar neighborhood are just as\nlikely to form around fast stars as they are around slow stars. Our work\nhighlights the subtle ways in which selection biases can create strong\ncorrelations without physical underpinnings.</td>

Therefore, we\nargue that, in the presence of gas, the dark halo plays a negligible role in\nthe tilting of the stellar disc. On the other hand, we find a strong\ncorrelation between the tilting rate of the stellar disc and the misalignment\nof the cold gas warp. Adding the stellar mass fraction improves the\ncorrelation, while none of the dark matter's properties together with the cold\ngas misalignment improves the correlation to any significant extent.

We estimate\ntheir ages with the precision of $\sim$0.15 dex. Many of these groups appear to\nbe filamentary or string-like, oriented in parallel to the Galactic plane, and\nsome span hundreds of pc in length. Most of these string lack a central\ncluster, indicating that their filamentary structure is primordial, rather than\nthe result of tidal stripping or dynamical processing. The youngest strings\n($<$100 Myr) are orthogonal to the Local Arm. The older ones appear to be\nremnants of several other arm-like structures that cannot be presently traced\nby dust and gas. The velocity dispersion measured from the ensemble of groups\nand strings increase with age, suggesting a timescale for dynamical heating of\n$\sim$300 Myr. This timescale is also consistent with the age at which the\npopulation of strings begins to decline, while the population in more compact\ngroups continues to increase, suggesting that dynamical processes are\ndisrupting the weakly bound string populations, leaving only individual\nclusters to be identified at the oldest ages. These data shed a new light on\nthe local galactic structure and a large scale cloud collapse.</td>

To\nthis end we assume that it is possible to infer the formation radius of a star\nif we know their elemental abundances and age as well as the metallicity\nprofile of the interstellar medium at the time of the formation of the star.\nUsing this information, coupled with orbital information derived from Gaia DR2\ndata and radial velocities from large spectroscopic surveys, we show that it is\npossible to isolate stellar samples such that we can start to quantify how\nimportant the role of churning is. We use data from APOGEE DR14, parallaxes\nfrom Gaia and stellar ages based on C and N elemental abundances in the stars.\nIn our sample, we find that about half of the stars have experienced some sort\nof radial migration (based solely on their orbital properties), 10 % have\nlikely have suffered only from churning, whilst a modest 5-7 % of stars have\nnever experienced either churning or blurring making them ideal tracers of the\noriginal properties of the cool stellar disk.

      <td>Mapping the Stellar Halo with the H3 Spectroscopic Survey</td>
      <td>Modern theories of galaxy formation predict that the Galactic stellar halo\nwas hierarchically assembled from the accretion and disruption of smaller\nsystems. This hierarchical assembly is expected to produce a high degree of\nstructure in the combined phase and chemistry space; this structure should\nprovide a relatively direct probe of the accretion history of our Galaxy.\nRevealing this structure requires precise 3D positions (including distances),\n3D velocities, and chemistry for large samples of stars. The Gaia satellite is\ndelivering proper motions and parallaxes for >1 billion stars to G~20. However,\nradial velocities and metallicities will only be available to G~15, which is\ninsufficient to probe the outer stellar halo (>10 kpc). Moreover, parallaxes\nwill not be precise enough to deliver high-quality distances for stars beyond\n~10 kpc. Identifying accreted systems throughout the stellar halo therefore\nrequires a large ground-based spectroscopic survey to complement Gaia. Here we\nprovide an overview of the H3 Stellar Spectroscopic Survey, which will deliver\nprecise stellar parameters and spectrophotometric distances for 200,000 stars\nto r=18. Spectra are obtained with the Hectochelle instrument at the MMT, which\nis configured for the H3 Survey to deliver resolution R~23,000 spectra covering\nthe wavelength range 5150A-5300A. The survey is optimized for stellar halo\nscience and therefore focuses on high Galactic latitude fields (|b|>30 deg.),\nsparsely sampling 15,000 sq. degrees. Targets are selected on the basis of Gaia\nparallaxes, enabling very efficient selection of bone fide halo stars. The\nsurvey began in the Fall of 2017 and has collected 88,000 spectra to-date. All\nof the data, including the derived stellar parameters, will eventually be made\npublicly available via the survey website: h3survey.rc.fas.harvard.edu.</td>

The offset between the\narms traced by stars and HMSFRs, i.e., gas, is difficult to be explained by the\ndynamic arm scenario. On the other hand, the pitch angle of the stellar Local\narm, if confirmed, larger than that of the Perseus arm is difficult to be\nexplained with the classical density-wave scenario. The dynamic arm scenario\ncan explain it if the Local arm is in a growing up phase, while the Perseus arm\nis in a disrupting phase.

      <td>Flying far and fast: the distribution of distant hypervelocity star candidates from Gaia DR2 data</td>
      <td>Context. Hypervelocity stars move fast enough to leave the gravitational\nfield of their home galaxies and venture into intergalactic space. The most\nextreme examples known have estimated speeds in excess of 1000 km/s. These can\nbe easily induced at the centres of galaxies via close encounters between\nbinary stars and supermassive black holes; however, a number of other\nmechanisms operating elsewhere can produce them as well.\n  Aims. Recent studies suggest that hypervelocity stars are ubiquitous in the\nlocal Universe. In the Milky Way, the known hypervelocity stars are\nanisotropically distributed, but it is unclear why. Here, we used Gaia Data\nRelease 2 (DR2) data to perform a systematic exploration aimed at confirming or\nrefuting these findings.\n  Methods. We assume that the farther the candidate hypervelocity stars are,\nthe more likely they are to be unbound from the Galaxy. We used the statistical\nanalysis of both the spatial distribution and kinematics of these objects to\nachieve our goals.\n  Results. Focussing on nominal Galactocentric distances greater than 30 kpc,\nwhich are the most distant candidates, we isolated a sample with speeds in\nexcess of 500 km/s that exhibits a certain degree of anisotropy but remains\ncompatible with possible systematic effects. We find that the effect of the\nEddington-Trumpler-Weaver bias is important in our case: over 80% of our\nsources are probably located further away than implied by their parallaxes;\ntherefore, most of our velocity estimates are lower limits. If this bias is as\nstrong as suggested here, the contamination by disc stars may not affect our\noverall conclusions.\n  Conclusions. The subsample with the lowest uncertainties shows stronger, but\nobviously systematic, anisotropies and includes a number of candidates of\npossible extragalactic origin and young age with speeds of up to 2000 km/s.</td>

We use a collisionless N-body simulation\nwith co-spatial thin and thick discs, along with orbit integration, to study\nthe orbital structure close to the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR) of the bar.\nWe find that a prominent, long-lived ridge is formed in the $V_{\phi}$-$r$\nplane due to the OLR which translates to streams in the $V_{\phi}$-$V_r$ plane\nand examine which closed periodic and trapped librating orbits are responsible\nfor these features. We find that orbits which carry out small librations around\nthe $x_1(1)$ family are preferentially found at negative $V_r$, giving rise to\na `horn'-like feature, while orbits with larger libration amplitudes, trapped\naround the $x_1(2)$ and $x_1(1)$ families, constitute the positive $V_r$\nsubstructure, i.e. the Hercules-like feature. This changing libration amplitude\nof orbits will translate to a changing ratio of thin/thick disc stars, which\ncould have implications on the metallicity distribution in this plane. We find\nthat a scenario in which the Sun is placed close to the OLR gives rise to a\nstrong asymmetry in $V_r$ in the $V_{\phi}$-$V_r$ plane (i.e. Hercules vs. `the\nhorn') and subsequently to undulations in the $V_{\phi}$-$r$-$V_r$ space.

      <td>Extraction of globular clusters members with Gaia DR2 astrometry</td>
      <td>In this work we present a method to identify possible members of globular\nclusters using data from Gaia DR2. The method consists of two stages: the first\none based on a clustering algorithm, and the second one based on the analysis\nof the projected spatial distribution of stars with different proper motions.\nIn order to confirm that the clusters members extracted by the method\ncorrespond to actual globular clusters, the spatial distribution, the vector\npoint diagram of the proper motions and the colour-magnitude diagrams are\nanalysed. We apply the developed method to eight clusters: NGC 1261, NGC 3201,\nNGC 6139, NGC 6205, NGC 6362, NGC 6397, NGC 6712 and Palomar 13; we show the\nnumber of members extracted, the mean proper motions derived from them and\nfinally we compare our results with other authors. In order to analyse the\nefficiency of the extraction method we perform an estimation of the\ncompleteness and the degree of contamination of the extracted members.</td>

      <td>Combining the precise parallaxes and optical photometry delivered by Gaia's\nsecond data release (Gaia DR2) with the photometric catalogues of PanSTARRS-1,\n2MASS, and AllWISE, we derive Bayesian stellar parameters, distances, and\nextinctions for 265 million stars brighter than G=18. Because of the wide\nwavelength range used, our results substantially improve the accuracy and\nprecision of previous extinction and effective temperature estimates. After\ncleaning our results for both unreliable input and output data, we retain 137\nmillion stars, for which we achieve a median precision of 5% in distance, 0.20\nmag in V-band extinction, and 245 K in effective temperature for G<14,\ndegrading towards fainter magnitudes (12%, 0.20 mag, and 245 K at G=16; 16%,\n0.23 mag, and 260 K at G=17, respectively). We find a very good agreement with\nthe asteroseismic surface gravities and distances of 7000 stars in the Kepler,\nthe K2-C3, and the K2-C6 fields, with stellar parameters from the APOGEE\nsurvey, as well as with distances to star clusters. Our results are available\nthrough the ADQL query interface of the Gaia mirror at the Leibniz-Institut\nf\"{u}r Astrophysik Potsdam (gaia.aip.de) and as binary tables at data.aip.de.\nAs a first application, in this paper we provide distance- and\nextinction-corrected colour-magnitude diagrams, extinction maps as a function\nof distance, and extensive density maps, demonstrating the potential of our\nvalue-added dataset for mapping the three-dimensional structure of our Galaxy.\nIn particular, we see a clear manifestation of the Galactic bar in the stellar\ndensity distributions, an observation that can almost be considered a direct\nimaging of the Galactic bar.</td>

      <td>Another relic bulge globular cluster: ESO 456-SC38 (Djorgovski~2)</td>
      <td>The object ESO456-SC38 (Djorgovski 2) is one of the globular clusters that is\nclosest to the Galactic center. It is on the blue horizontal branch and has a\nmoderate metallicity of [Fe/H]~-1.0. It is thus similar to the very old inner\nbulge globular clusters NGC 6522, NGC 6558, and HP 1, and therefore appears to\nbe part of the primeval formation stages of the Milky Way. The aim of this work\nis to determine an accurate distance and metallicity for ESO456-SC38, as well\nas orbital parameters, in order to check similarities with other clusters in\nthe inner bulge that have previously been well studied in terms of spectroscopy\nand photometry. This is a considerably fainter cluster that is contaminated by\na rich stellar field; it is also quite absorbed by the dusty foreground. We\nanalyzed ESO456-SC38 based on Hubble Space Telescope photometry, with the\nfilters F606W from ACS, F110W and F160W from WFC3,and photometry in V and I\nfrom FORS2 at the VLT. We combined this with identified stars that are covered\nby Gaia Data Release 2. The isochrone fitting was carried out with the\nstatistical Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We derive an accurate distance of\ndSun = 8.75+-0.12 kpc and a reddening of E(B-V)=0.81^+0.02_-0.02. The\nbest-fitting BaSTI isochrones correspond to an age of 12.70^{+0.72}_{-0.69} Gyr\nand a metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.11^{+0.03}_{-0.03}. ESO 456-SC38 adds to the\nlist of moderately metal-poor globular clusters located in the inner bulge. It\nis on the blue horizontal branch and is very old. The cluster is confined to\nthe bulge and bar region, but it does not support the Galactic bar structure.\nThe old stellar population represented by clusters like this has to be taken\ninto account in models of Galactic bulge formation. Studying them also provides\nindications on the formation times of the globular clusters themselves.</td>

The axisymmetric limit of the shearing sheet is derived and used\nto re-derive Kalnajs' 1965 dispersion relation and Toomre's 1964 stability\ncriterion for axisymmetric disturbances. Using the shearing sheet to revisit\nToomre's important 1969 paper on the group velocity implied by Lin-Shu-Kalnajs\ndispersion relation, we discover that two rather than one wavepackets emerges\ninside corotation: one each side of the inner Lindblad resonance. Although LSK\ndispersion relation provides useful interpretations of both wavepackets, the\nshearing sheet highlights the limitations of the LSK approach to disc dynamics.\nDisturbances by no means avoid an annulus around corotation, as the LSK\ndispersion relation implies. While disturbances of the shearing sheet have a\nlimited life in real space, they live on much longer in velocity space, which\nGaia allows us to probe extensively.

Few open\nclusters have been studied in detail in the inner disc region before the\nGaia-ESO Survey. New data from the Gaia-ESO Survey allowed us to conduct an\nextended radial velocity membership study as well as spectroscopic metallicity\nand detailed chemical abundance measurements for this cluster. Gaia-ESO Survey\ndata for 142 potential members, lying on the upper MS and on the red clump,\nyielded radial velocity measurements, which, together with proper motion\nmeasurements from the Gaia DR2, were used to determine the systemic velocity of\nthe cluster and membership of individual stars. Photometry from Gaia DR2 was\nused to re-determine cluster parameters based on high confidence member stars\nonly. Cluster abundance measurements of six radial-velocity member stars with\nUVES high-resolution spectroscopy are presented for 23 elements. According to\nthe new estimates, based on high confidence members, Pismis 18 has an age of\n$700^{+40}_{-50}$ Myr, interstellar reddening of E(B-V) =\n$0.562^{+0.012}_{-0.026}$ mag and a de-reddened distance modulus of $DM_0 =\n11.96^{+0.10}_{-0.24}$ mag. The median metallicity of the cluster (using the\nsix UVES stars) is [Fe/H] = $+0.23 \pm 0.05$ dex, with [$\alpha$/Fe]= $0.07 \pm\n0.13$ and a slight enhancement of s- and r- neutron-capture elements. With the\npresent work, we fully characterized the open cluster Pismis 18, confirming its\npresent location in the inner disc. We estimated a younger age than the\nprevious literature values and gave, for the first time, its metallicity and\nits detailed abundances. Its [$\alpha$/Fe] and [s-process/Fe], both slightly\nsuper-solar, are in agreement with other inner-disc open clusters observed by\nthe Gaia-ESO survey. [abridged]</td>

We\ninvestigate whether a reported `halo' of stars around FSR1758 is related to the\ncluster, and find that most of these stars are likely foreground dwarf stars.\nWe conclude that FSR1758 is not a dwarf galaxy, but rather a globular cluster.</td>

      <td>On measuring the Galactic dark matter halo with hypervelocity stars</td>
      <td>Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) travel from the Galactic Centre across the dark\nmatter halo of the Milky Way, where they are observed with velocities in excess\nof the Galactic escape speed. Because of their quasi-radial trajectories, they\nrepresent a unique probe of the still poorly constrained dark matter component\nof the Galactic potential. In this paper, we present a new method to produce\nsuch constraints. Our likelihood is based on the local HVS density obtained by\nback-propagating the observed phase space position and quantifies the ejection\nprobability along the orbit. To showcase our method, we apply it to simulated\nGaia samples of $\sim200$ stars in three realistic Galactic potentials with\ndark matter components parametrized by spheroidal NFW profiles. We find that\nindividual HVSs exhibit a degeneracy in the scale mass-scale radius plane\n($M_s-r_s$) and are able to measure only the combination $\alpha = M_s/r_s^2$.\nLikewise, a degeneracy is also present between $\alpha$ and the spheroidal\naxis-ratio $q$. In the absence of observational errors, we show the whole\nsample can nail down both parameters with {\it sub-per cent} precision (about\n$1\%$ and $0.1\%$ for $\alpha$ and $q$ respectively) with no systematic bias.\nThis remarkable power to constrain deviations from a symmetric halo is a\nconsequence of the Galactocentric origin of HVSs. To compare our results with\nother probes, we break the degeneracy in the scale parameters and impose a\nmass-concentration relation. The result is a competitive precision on the\nvirial mass $M_{200}$ of about $10\%$.</td>

      <td>The hidden giant: discovery of an enormous Galactic dwarf satellite in Gaia DR2</td>

The Antlia 2 dwarf galaxy is located behind the Galactic disc at a\nlatitude of $b\sim 11^{\circ}$ and spans $1.26$ degrees, which corresponds to\n$\sim2.9$ kpc at its distance of 130 kpc. While similar in spatial extent to\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud, Antlia 2 is orders of magnitude fainter at $M_V=-9$\nmag, making it by far the lowest surface brightness system known (at $\sim31.9$\nmag/arcsec$^2$), $\sim100$ times more diffuse than the so-called ultra diffuse\ngalaxies. The satellite was identified using a combination of astrometry,\nphotometry and variability data from \textit{Gaia} Data Release 2, and its\nnature confirmed with deep archival DECam imaging, which revealed a conspicuous\nBHB signal. We have also obtained follow-up spectroscopy using AAOmega on the\nAAT, identifying 159 member stars, and we used them to measure the dwarf's\nsystemic velocity, $290.9\pm0.5$km/s, its velocity dispersion, $5.7\pm1.1$\nkm/s, and mean metallicity, [Fe/H]$=-1.4$. From these properties we conclude\nthat Antlia 2 inhabits one of the least dense Dark Matter (DM) halos probed to\ndate. Dynamical modelling and tidal-disruption simulations suggest that a\ncombination of a cored DM profile and strong tidal stripping may explain the\nobserved properties of this satellite. The origin of this core may be\nconsistent with aggressive feedback, or may even require alternatives to cold\ndark matter (such as ultra-light bosons).</td>

Here, we provide dynamical and chemical evidence for a\nsecond substantial accretion episode, distinct from the Gaia Sausage. The\nSequoia Event provided the bulk of the high energy retrograde stars in the\nstellar halo, as well as the recently discovered globular cluster FSR 1758.\nThere are up to 6 further globular clusters, including $\omega$~Centauri, as\nwell as many of the retrograde substructures in Myeong et al. (2018),\nassociated with the progenitor dwarf galaxy, named the Sequoia. The stellar\nmass in the Sequoia galaxy is $\sim 5 \times 10^{7} M_\odot$, whilst the total\nmass is $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$, as judged from abundance matching or from the\ntotal sum of the globular cluster mass. Although clearly less massive than the\nSausage, the Sequoia has a distinct chemo-dynamical signature. The strongly\nretrograde Sequoia stars have a typical eccentricity of $\sim0.6$, whereas the\nSausage stars have no clear net rotation and move on predominantly radial\norbits. On average, the Sequoia stars have lower metallicity by $\sim 0.3$ dex\nand higher abundance ratios as compared to the Sausage. We conjecture that the\nSausage and the Sequoia galaxies may have been associated and accreted at a\ncomparable epoch.</td>

The variation of the rotation velocity with the\nmetallicity shows a positive gradient for the thick disk stars and a negative\none for the thin disk stars. Comparisons of our observed results with models of\ndisk formation suggest that radial migration could have influenced the chemical\nevolution of the thin disk. The formation of the thick disk could be affected\nby more than one processes: the accretion model could play an indispensable\nrole, while other formation mechanisms, such as the radial migration or heating\nscenario model could also have a contribution.</td>

      <td>Implications of a time-varying Galactic potential for determinations of the dynamical surface density</td>
      <td>Recent studies have shown that the passage of a massive satellite through the\ndisk of a spiral galaxy can induce vertical wobbles in the disk and produce\nfeatures such as in-plane rings and phase-space spirals. Here we analyze a\nhigh-resolution N-body simulation of a live stellar disk perturbed by the\nrecent passage of a massive dwarf galaxy that induces such perturbations. We\nstudy the implications of the phase-space structures for the estimate of the\nmatter density through traditional Jeans modelling. The dwarf satellite excites\nrapid time-variations in the potential, leading to a significant bias of the\nlocal matter surface density determined through such a method. In particular,\nwhile the Jeans modelling gives reasonable estimates in the most overdense\nregions of the disk, we show that it tends to overestimate the dynamical\nsurface density in underdense regions. In these regions, the phase-space spiral\nis indeed more marked in the surface of section of height vs. vertical\nvelocity. This prediction can be verified with future Gaia data releases. Our\nfinding is highly relevant for future attempts at determining the dynamical\nsurface density of the outer Milky Way disk as a function of radius. The outer\ndisk of the Milky Way is indeed heavily perturbed, and \textit{Gaia} DR2 data\nhave clearly shown that such phase-space perturbations are even present\nlocally. While our results show that traditional Jeans modelling should give\nreliable results in overdense regions of the disk, the important biases in\nunderdense regions call for the development of non-equilibrium methods to\nestimate the dynamical matter density locally and in the outer disk.</td>

      <td>Testing dark matter and geometry sustained circular velocities in the Milky Way with Gaia DR2</td>
      <td>Flat rotation curves in disk galaxies represent the main evidence for large\namounts of surrounding dark matter. Despite of the difficulty in identifying\nthe dark matter contribution to the total mass density in our Galaxy, stellar\nkinematics, as tracer of gravitational potential, is the most reliable\nobservable for gauging different matter components. This work tests the\nflatness of the MW rotation curve with a simple general relativistic model\nsuitable to represent the geometry of a disk as a stationary axisymmetric dust\nmetric at a sufficiently large distance from a central body. Circular\nvelocities of unprecedented accuracy were derived from the Gaia DR2 data for a\ncarefully selected sample of disk stars. We then fit these velocities to both\nthe classical, i.e. including a dark matter halo, rotation curve model and a\nrelativistic analogue, as derived form the solution of Einstein's equation. The\nGR-compliant MW rotational curve model results statistically indistinguishable\nfrom its state-of-the-art DM analogue. This supports our ansatz that a\nstationary and axisymmetric galaxy-scale metric could "fill the gap" in a\nbaryons-only Milky Way, suggestive of star orbits dragged along the background\ngeometry. We confirmed that geometry is a manifestation of gravity according to\nthe Einstein theory, in particular the weak gravitational effect due to the\noff-diagonal term of the metric could mimic for a "DM-like" effect in the\nobserved flatness of the MW rotation curve. In the context of Local Cosmology,\nour findings are suggestive of a Galaxy phase-space as the exterior\ngravitational field of a Kerr-like source (inner rotating bulge) without the\nneed of extra-matter.</td>

      <td>Gaia kinematics reveal a complex lopsided and twisted Galactic disc warp</td>
      <td>There are few warp kinematic models of the Galaxy able to characterise\nstructure and kinematics. These models are necessary to study the lopsidedness\nof the warp and the twisting of the line-of-nodes of the stellar warp, already\nseen in gas and dust. We use the \Gaia~Data Release 2 astrometric data up to\n$G=20$mag to characterise the structure of the Galactic warp, the vertical\nmotions and the dependency on the age. We use two populations up to\ngalactocentric distances of $16$kpc, a young (OB-type) and an old (Red Giant\nBranch, RGB). We use the nGC3 PCM and LonKin methods based on the Gaia\nobservables, together with 2D projections of the positions and proper motions\nin the Galactic plane. We confirm the age dependency of the Galactic warp, both\nin positions and kinematics, being the height of the Galactic warp of about\n$0.2$kpc for the OB sample and of $1.$kpc for the RGB at a galactocentric\ndistance of $14$kpc. Both methods find that the onset radius is $12\sim 13$kpc\nfor the OB sample and $10\sim 11$kpc for the RGB. From the RGB sample, we find\nfrom galactocentric distances larger than $10$kpc the line-of-nodes twists away\nfrom the Sun-anticentre line towards galactic azimuths $\sim 180-200^{\circ}$\nincreasing with radius, though possibly influenced by extinction. The RGB\nsample reveals a slightly lopsided stellar warp with $\sim 250$pc between the\nup and down sides. The line of maximum of proper motions in latitude is\nsystematically offset from the line-of-nodes estimated from the spatial data,\nwhich our models predict as a kinematic signature of lopsidedness. We also show\na prominent wave-like pattern of a bending mode different in the OB and RGB,\nand substructures that might not be related to the Galactic warp nor to a\nbending mode. GDR2 triggers the need for complex kinematic models, flexible\nenough to combine both wave-like patterns and an S-shaped lopsided\nwarp.[abridged]</td>

Spectroscopy of the four confirmed\nLP 40-365 stars finds ONe-dominated atmospheres enriched with remarkably\nsimilar amounts of nuclear ashes of partial O- and Si-burning. Kinematic\nevidence is consistent with ejection from a binary supernova progenitor; at\nleast two stars have rest-frame velocities indicating they are unbound to the\nGalaxy.

      <td>Multiple components of the Jhelum stellar stream</td>
      <td>In simple models of the Milky Way, tidally disrupting satellites produce long\nand thin---nearly one-dimensional---stellar streams. Using astrometric data\nfrom the Gaia second data release and photometry from the Dark Energy Survey,\nwe demonstrate that the Jhelum stream, a stellar stream in the inner halo, is a\ntwo-dimensional structure. The spatial distribution of highly probable Jhelum\nmembers reveals a dense thin component and an associated diffuse, spatially\noffset component. These two spatial components have indistinguishable proper\nmotions (at $\sigma\sim1\,\rm mas\,yr^{-1}$ level) and a similar ratio of blue\nstraggler to blue horizontal branch stars, which indicates a common origin for\nthe two components. The best-fit orbit to the narrow component (pericenter\n$8\,\rm kpc$, apocenter $24\,\rm kpc$), however, does not explain the wide\ncomponent of the Jhelum stream. On the other hand, an older orbital wrap of\nJhelum's orbit traces the Indus stream, indicating a possible connection\nbetween these two structures and additional complexity in Jhelum's formation.\nSubstructure in the Jhelum progenitor or precession of its tidal debris in the\nMilky Way potential may explain the observed structure of Jhelum. Future\nspectroscopic data will enable discrimination between these "nature" and\n"nurture" formation scenarios. Jhelum adds to the growing list of cold stellar\nstreams that display complex morphologies and promise to reveal the dynamical\nhistory of the Milky Way.</td>

      <td>Asymmetric Mean Metallicity Distribution of the Milky Way's Disk</td>
      <td>I present the mean metallicity distribution of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy\nbased on photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. I utilize an empirically\ncalibrated set of stellar isochrones developed in previous work to estimate the\nmetallicities of individual stars to a precision of $0.2$ dex for reasonably\nbright stars across the survey area. I also obtain more precise metallicity\nestimates using priors from the $Gaia$ parallaxes for relatively nearby stars.\nClose to the Galactic mid-plane ($|Z|<2$ kpc), a mean metallicity map reveals\ndeviations from the mirror symmetry between the northern and southern\nhemispheres, displaying wave-like oscillations. The observed metallicity\nasymmetry structure is almost parallel to the Galactic mid-plane, and coincides\nwith the previously known asymmetry in the stellar number density distribution.\nThis result reinforces the previous notion of the plane-parallel vertical waves\npropagating through the disk, in which a local metallicity perturbation from\nthe mean vertical metallicity gradient is induced by the phase-space wrapping\nof stars in the $Z$-$V_Z$ plane. The maximum amplitude of the metallicity\nasymmetry ($\Delta$[Fe/H]$\sim0.05$) implies that these stars have been pulled\naway from the Galactic mid-plane by an order of $\Delta|Z|\sim80$ pc as a\nmassive halo substructure such as the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy plunged through\nthe Milky Way. This work provides evidence that the $Gaia$ phase-space spiral\nmay continue out to $|Z|\sim1.5$ kpc.</td>

      <td>Distribution of red clump stars does not support the X-shaped Galactic bulge</td>
      <td>CONTEXT. Claims of an X-shaped Galactic bulge were based on the assumption of\nred clump stars as standard candles in some lines of sight crossing the\noff-plane bulge. However, some doubts have been cast on whether the two peaks\nin star counts along the line of sight really represent a double peak in the\ndensity distribution, or whether there is something wrong with the assumption\nof a unique constant absolute magnitude for all of these stars.\n  AIMS. With the advent of Gaia-DR2 parallaxes in combination with\nnear-infrared VISTA-VVV data, we are able to check which of the hypotheses is\ncorrect.\n  METHODS. We calculated the median absolute magnitude $M_K$ corresponding to\nboth peaks of putative red clumps in seven lines of sight with the lowest\nextinction in the interesting coordinates' range.\n  RESULTS. The difference between the absolute magnitude of the bright and the\nfaint peak is $\Delta M_K\approx 0.4$. The selected stars in both peaks cannot\nbe represented by the same red clump giants with constant $M_K\approx -1.6$.\n  CONCLUSIONS. The hypothesis that the bulge contains an X-shape is based on\nthe assumption that the faint and bright peaks of the density distribution\ntowards the bulge are dominated by standard red clump stars. However, we show\nthat both the faint and bright peaks cannot be dominated by standard red clump\nstars simultaneously.</td>

      <td>We introduce an extension of the ELVIS project to account for the effects of\nthe Milky Way galaxy on its subhalo population. Our simulation suite, Phat\nELVIS, consists of twelve high-resolution cosmological dark matter-only (DMO)\nzoom simulations of Milky Way-size $\Lambda$CDM~ haloes ($M_{\rm v} = 0.7-2\n\times 10^{12} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) along with twelve re-runs with embedded\ngalaxy potentials grown to match the observed Milky Way disk and bulge today.\nThe central galaxy potential destroys subhalos on orbits with small pericenters\nin every halo, regardless of the ratio of galaxy mass to halo mass. This has\nseveral important implications. 1) Most of the $\mathtt{Disk}$ runs have no\nsubhaloes larger than $V_{\rm max} = 4.5$ km s$^{-1}$ within $20$ kpc and a\nsignificant lack of substructure going back $\sim 8$ Gyr, suggesting that local\nstream-heating signals from dark substructure will be rare. 2) The pericenter\ndistributions of Milky Way satellites derived from $\mathit{Gaia}$ data are\nremarkably similar to the pericenter distributions of subhaloes in the\n$\mathtt{Disk}$ runs, while the DMO runs drastically over-predict galaxies with\npericenters smaller than 20 kpc. 3) The enhanced destruction produces a tension\nopposite to that of the classic `missing satellites' problem: in order to\naccount for ultra-faint galaxies known within $30$ kpc of the Galaxy, we must\npopulate haloes with $V_\mathrm{peak} \simeq 7$ km s$^{-1}$ ($M \simeq 3 \times\n10^{7} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at infall), well below the atomic cooling limit of\n$V_\mathrm{peak} \simeq 16$ km s$^{-1}$ ($M \simeq 5 \times 10^{8}\n\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at infall). 4) If such tiny haloes do host ultra-faint\ndwarfs, this implies the existence of $\sim 1000$ satellite galaxies within 300\nkpc of the Milky Way.</td>

We determine the vertical and radial velocity dispersions, finding that\nthe low and high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ discs display markedly different\nage--velocity-dispersion relations (AVRs) and shapes $\sigma_z/\sigma_R$. The\nhigh $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc has roughly flat AVRs and constant\n$\sigma_z/\sigma_R = 0.64\pm 0.04$, whereas the low $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc\nhas large variations in this ratio which positively correlate with the mean\norbital radius of the population at fixed age. The high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$\ndisc component's flat AVRs and constant $\sigma_z/\sigma_R$ clearly indicates\nan entirely different heating history. Outer disc populations also have flatter\nradial AVRs than those in the inner disc, likely due to the waning effect of\nspiral arms. Our detailed measurements of AVRs and $\sigma_z/\sigma_R$ across\nthe disc indicate that low $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$, inner disc ($R \lesssim\n10\,\mathrm{kpc}$) stellar populations are likely dynamically heated by both\ngiant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while the observed trends for outer\ndisc populations require a significant contribution from another heating\nmechanism such as satellite perturbations.

In contrast to other methods, which\nrely on special sources, our method directly tests the distances to all stars\nin our sample. We find clear evidence for a near-linear trend of distance bias\nf with distance s, proving a parallax offset delta p. On average, we find delta\np = -0.054 mas (parallaxes in Gaia DR2 need to be increased) when accounting\nfor the parallax uncertainty under-estimate in the Gaia set (delta p = -0.048\nmas on the raw parallax errors) with negligible formal error and a systematic\nuncertainty of about 0.006 mas. The value is in concordance with results from\nasteroseismic measurements, but differs from the much lower bias found on\nquasar samples. We further use our method to compile a comprehensive set of\nquality cuts in colour, apparent magnitude, and astrometric parameters. Last,\nwe find that for this sample delta p appears to strongly depend on the parallax\nuncertainty sigma_p (when including the additional 0.043 mas) with a\nstatistical confidence far in excess of 10\sigma and a proportionality factor\nclose to 1, though the dependence varies somewhat with sigma_p. Correcting for\nthe sigma_p dependence also resolves otherwise unexplained correlations of the\noffset with the number of observation periods n_{vis} and ecliptic latitude.\nEvery study using Gaia DR2 parallaxes/distances should investigate the\nsensitivity of their results on the parallax biases described here and - for\nfainter samples - in the DR2 astrometry paper.</td>

New proper motions from the\nsecond $Gaia$ data release reconcile the direction of motion of stream members\nwith the stream arc, resolving a puzzling mismatch reported in earlier work. We\nuse N-body simulations to show that the stream is likely only on its second\npericentric passage, and thus was formed recently. The simulations suggest that\nthe entire disrupted progenitor is visible in the observed stream today, and\nthat little further tidal debris lies beyond the ends of the stream. The\nluminosity, length, width, and velocity dispersion of the stream suggest a\nglobular cluster (GC) progenitor substantially fainter and of lower surface\nbrightness than estimated in previous work, and unlike any other known\nglobulars in the Galaxy. This result suggests the existence of clusters that\nwould extend the known GC population to fainter and more weakly bound systems\nthan hitherto known. How such a weakly-bound cluster of old stars survived\nuntil it was disrupted so recently, however, remains a mystery. Integrating\nbackwards in time, we find that the orbits of Sagittarius and Ophiuchus passed\nwithin $\sim 5$ kpc of each other about $\sim 100$ Myrs ago, an interaction\nthat might help resolve this puzzle.</td>

Recently, thanks to Gaia data, it has been possible to construct the\nluminosity function of massive (0.9 < M/Msun < 1.1) white dwarfs in the solar\nneighborhood (d < 100 pc). Since the lifetime of their progenitors is very\nshort, the birth times of both, parents and daughters, are very close and allow\nto reconstruct the (effective) star formation rate. This rate started growing\nfrom zero during the early Galaxy and reached a maximum 6-7 Gyr ago. It\ndeclined and ~5 Gyr ago started to climb once more reaching a maximum 2 - 3 Gyr\nin the past and decreased since then. There are some traces of a recent star\nformation burst, but the method used here is not appropriate for recently born\nwhite dwarfs.</td>

      <td>Hypervelocity Stars from a Supermassive Black Hole-Intermediate-mass Black Hole binary</td>
      <td>In this paper we consider a scenario where the currently observed\nhypervelocity stars in our Galaxy have been ejected from the Galactic center as\na result of dynamical interactions with an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH)\norbiting the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). By performing 3-body\nscattering experiments, we calculate the distribution of the ejected stars'\nvelocities given various parameters of the IMBH-SMBH binary: IMBH mass,\nsemimajor axis and eccentricity. We also calculate the rates of change of the\nBH binary orbital elements due to those stellar ejections. One of our new\nfindings is that the ejection rate depends (although mildly) on the rotation of\nthe stellar nucleus (its total angular momentum). We also compare the ejection\nvelocity distribution with that produced by the Hills mechanism (stellar binary\ndisruption) and find that the latter produces faster stars on average. Also,\nthe IMBH mechanism produces an ejection velocity distribution which is\nflattened towards the BH binary plane while the Hills mechanism produces a\nspherically symmetric one. The results of this paper will allow us in the\nfuture to model the ejection of stars by an evolving BH binary and compare both\nmodels with \textit{Gaia} observations, for a wide variety of environments\n(galactic nuclei, globular clusters, the Large Magellanic Clouds, etc.).</td>

      <td>The Perseus Arm is the closest Galactic spiral arm from the Sun, offering an\nexcellent opportunity to study in detail its stellar population. However, its\ndistance has been controversial with discrepancies by a factor of two.\nKinematic distances are in the range 3.9-4.2 kpc as compared to 1.9-2.3 kpc\nfrom spectrophotometric and trigonometric parallaxes, reinforcing previous\nclaims that this arm exhibits peculiar velocities. We used the astrometric\ninformation of a sample of 31 OB stars from the star-forming W3 Complex to\nidentify another 37 W3 members and to derive its distance from their Gaia-DR2\nparallaxes with improved accuracy. The Gaia-DR2 distance to the W3\nComplex,2.14$^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ kpc, coincides with the previous stellar\ndistances of $\sim$ 2 kpc. The Gaia-DR2 parallaxes tentatively show\ndifferential distances for different parts of the W3 Complex: W3 Main, located\nto the NE direction, is at 2.30$^{+0.19}_{-0.16}$ kpc, the W3 Cluster (IC\n1795), in the central region of the complex, is at 2.17$^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ kpc,\nand W3(OH) is at 2.00$^{+0.29}_{-0.23}$ kpc to the SW direction.

This research was\nperformed using homogeneous data set of young open clusters (age < 50 Myr)\ndetermined from Gaia DR2 data. The stellar astrometric membership were\ndetermined using proper motions and parallaxes, taking into account the full\ncovariance matrix. The distance, age, reddening and metallicity of the clusters\nwere determined by our non subjective multidimensional global optimization tool\nto fit theoretical isochrones to Gaia DR2 photometric data. The rotation speed\nof the arms is obtained from the relation between age and angular distance of\nthe birthplace of the clusters to the present-day position of the arms. Using\nthe clusters belonging to the Sagittarius-Carina, Local and Perseus arms, and\nadopting the Galactic parameters $R_0$ = 8.3 kpc and $V_0$ = 240 km\,s$^{-1}$,\nwe determine a pattern speed of $28.2 \pm 2.1$ km\,s$^{-1}$\,kpc$^{-1}$, with\nno difference between the arms.

We obtained moderate-resolution ($R\sim$ 6000) spectra of these stars\nto estimate their abundances of several chemical elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr,\nFe, and Ni), and derived their space velocity components and orbital parameters\nusing proper motions from \gaia\ Data Release 2. All six stars are shown to be\nbound to the Milky Way, and in fact are not even considered high-velocity stars\nwith respect to the Galactic rest frame. Nevertheless, we attempt to\ncharacterize their parent Galactic stellar components by simultaneously\ncomparing their abundance patterns and orbital parameters with those expected\nfrom various Galactic stellar components. We find that two of our program stars\nare typical disk stars. For four of the program stars, even though their\nkinematic probabilistic membership assignment suggests membership in the\nGalactic disk, based on their distinct orbital properties and chemical\ncharacteristics, we cannot rule out the exotic origins of these objects, as\nfollows. Two stars appear to be runaway stars from the Galactic disk. One\nprogram star has possibly been accreted from a disrupted dwarf galaxy or\ndynamically heated from a birthplace in the Galactic bulge. The last object may\nbe either a runaway disk star or has been dynamically heated. Spectroscopic\nfollow-up observations with higher resolution for these curious objects will\nprovide a better understanding of their origin.</td>

We find that the LMC can produce precisely the observed\nmotion-track mismatch and we therefore use the Orphan stream to measure the\nmass of the Cloud. We simultaneously fit the Milky Way and LMC potentials and\ninfer that a total LMC mass of $1.38^{+0.27}_{-0.24}\n\times10^{11}\,\rm{M_\odot}$ is required to bend the Orphan Stream, showing for\nthe first time that the LMC has a large and measurable effect on structures\norbiting the Milky Way.

Furthermore, we\nmeasure the Milky Way mass within 50 kpc to be\n$3.80^{+0.14}_{-0.11}\times10^{11} M_\odot$.

We examine the chemistry, kinematics, and dynamics of this metal-rich\nhalo sample using chemical abundances and radial velocities provided by the\nfourteenth APOGEE data release (DR14) and proper motions from the second Gaia\ndata release (DR2).

The high-[Mg/Fe] population exhibits a mean prograde\nrotation, as well as orbits that are more bound and closer to the plane,\nwhereas the low-[Mg/Fe] population has $<V>$ closer to 0, and stars that move\nin less-bound orbits reaching larger distances from the centre and the Galactic\nplane.

It has been suggested that these\npulsationally clumped RR01 stars are a relic of a disrupted dwarf galaxy or\nstellar cluster, as they also appear to be spatially coherent in a vertical\nstrip across the bulge. However, the radial velocities of the stars presented\nhere, along with proper motions from Gaia DR2, show a large range of radial\nvelocities, proper motions and distances for the bulge RR01 stars in the\npulsation clump, much larger than the RR01 stars in the Sagittarius dwarf\ngalaxy (Sgr). Therefore, in contrast to the kinematics of the RRL stars\nbelonging to Sgr, and those in and surrounding the bulge globular cluster\nNGC~6441, there is no obvious kinematic signature within the pulsationally\nclumped RR01 stars. If the pulsationally clumped RR01 stars belonged to the\nsame system in the past and were accreted, their accretion in the inner Galaxy\nwas not recent, as the kinematic signature of this group has been lost (i.e.,\nthese stars are now well-mixed within the inner Galaxy). We show that the\napparent spatial coherence reported for these stars could have been caused by\nsmall number statistics. The orbits of the RR01 stars in the inner Galaxy\nsuggest they are confined to the innermost ~4~kpc of the Milky Way.</td>

      <td>The vertical motion history of disk stars throughout the Galaxy</td>
      <td>It has long been known that the vertical motions of Galactic disk stars\nincrease with stellar age, commonly interpreted as vertical heating through\norbit scattering. Here we map the vertical actions of disk stars as a function\nof age ($\tau\le$ 8 Gyrs) and across a large range of Galactocentric radii,\n$\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$, drawing on APOGEE and Gaia data. We fit\n$\widehat{J_z}(\overline{R}_{\rm GC},\tau )$ as a combination of the vertical\naction at birth, $\widehat{J_{z,0}}$, and subsequent heating $\widehat{\Delta\nJ_z}_{\, {\rm 1Gyr}}(\overline{R}_{\rm GC})$ that scales as\n$\tau^{\gamma(\overline{R}_{\rm GC})}$. The inferred birth temperature,\n$\widehat{J_{z,0}}(\overline{R}_{\rm GC})$ is 1 kpc km/s for 3 kpc <\n$\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$ < 10 kpc, consistent with the ISM velocity dispersion;\nbut it rapidly rises outward, to 8 kpc km/s for $\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$ = 14\nkpc, likely reflecting the stars' birth in a warped or flared gas disk. We find\nthe heating rate $\widehat{\Delta J_z}_{\, {\rm 1Gyr}}$ to be modest and nearly\nconstant across all radii, 1.6 kpc km/s Gyr$^{-1}$. The stellar age dependence\n$\gamma$ gently grows with Galactocentric radius, from $\gamma \simeq$ 1 for\n$\overline{R}_{\rm GC}\lesssim R_\odot$ to $\gamma \simeq$ 1.3 at\n$\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$ =14 kpc. The observed $J_z - \tau$ relation at all\nradii is considerably steeper ($\gamma\gtrsim$ 1) than the time dependence\ntheoretically expected from orbit scattering, $J_z\propto t^{0.5}$. We\nillustrate how this conundrum can be resolved if we also account for the fact\nthat at earlier epochs the scatterers were more common, and the restoring force\nfrom the stellar disk surface mass density was low. Our analysis may re-instate\ngradual orbital scattering as a plausible and viable mechanism to explain the\nage-dependent vertical motions of disk stars.</td>

We adopt magnesium\nabundance as an $\alpha$-abundance proxy for our clean sample as it has been\nproven to be the most accurate $\alpha$-element as determined by ASPCAP, the\npipeline for data products from APOGEE spectra. From the distribution of our\nbulge sample in the [Mg/Fe]-versus-[Fe/H] plane, we found that the sequence is\nbimodal. This bimodality is given by the presence of a low-Mg sequence of stars\nparallel to the main high-Mg sequence over a range of $\sim 0.5$~dex around\nsolar metallicity. The two sequences merge above ${\rm [Fe/H]\sim0.15~ dex}$\ninto a single sequence whose dispersion in [Mg/Fe] is larger than either of the\ntwo sequences visible at lower metallicity. This result is confirmed when we\nconsider stars in our sample that are inside the bulge region according to\ntrustworthy Gaia DR2 distances.</td>

      <td>Globular cluster candidates in the Galactic bulge: Gaia and VVV view of the latest discoveries</td>
      <td>Thanks to the recent wide-area photometric surveys, the number of star\ncluster candidates have risen exponentially in the last few years. Most\ndetections, however, are based only on the presence of an overdensity of stars\nin a given region, or an overdensity of variable stars, regardless of their\ndistance. As candidates, their detection has not been dynamically confirmed.\nTherefore, it is currently unknown how many, and which ones, of the published\ncandidates, are true clusters, and which ones are chance alignments. We present\na method to detect and confirm star clusters based on the spatial distribution,\ncoherence in motion and appearance on the color-magnitude diagram. We explain\nand apply it to one new star cluster, and several candidate star clusters\npublished in the literature. The presented method is based on data from the\nSecond Data Release of Gaia complemented with data from the VISTA Variables in\nthe V\'ia L\'actea survey for the innermost bulge regions. It consists of a\nnearest neighbors algorithm applied simultaneously over spatial coordinates,\nstar color, and proper motions, in order to detect groups of stars that are\nclose in the sky, move coherently and define narrow sequences in the\ncolor-magnitude diagram, such as a young main sequence or a red giant branch.\nWhen tested in the bulge area ($-10<\ell\ {\rm (deg)}<+10$; $-10<b\ {\rm\n(deg)}<+10$) the method successfully recovered several known young and old star\nclusters. We report here the detection of one new, likely old star cluster,\nwhile deferring the others to a forthcoming paper. Additionally, the code has\nbeen applied to the position of 93 candidate star clusters published in the\nliterature. As a result, only two of them are confirmed as coherently moving\ngroups of stars at their nominal positions.</td>

Stellar parameters and individual abundances\nfor 25 chemical elements (from Li to Eu) are presented for the first time.\nThese stars exhibit chemical abundance patterns that are similar to those\nreported in other literature studies of very and extremely metal-poor stars.\nOne of our targets, J2114$-$0616, shows high enhancement in carbon\n([C/Fe]=1.37), nitrogen ([N/Fe]= 1.88), barium ([Ba/Fe]=1.00), and europium\n([Eu/Fe]=0.84). Such chemical abundance pattern suggests that J2114$-$0616 can\nbe classified as CEMP-r/s star. In addition, the star J1054+0528 can be\nclassified as a CEMP-rI star, with [Eu/Fe]=0.44 and [Ba/Fe]=$-$0.52. The other\nstars in our sample show no enhancements in neutron-capture elements and can be\nclassified as CEMP-no stars. We also performed a kinematic and dynamical\nanalysis of the sample stars based on Gaia DR2 data. The kinematic parameters,\norbits, and binding energy of these stars, show that J2114$-$0616 is member of\nthe outer halo population, while the remaining stars belong to the inner halo\npopulation but with an accreted origin.

      <td>The signatures of the resonances of a large Galactic bar in local velocity space</td>
      <td>The second data release of the Gaia mission has revealed a very rich\nstructure in local velocity space. In terms of in-plane motions, this rich\nstructure is also seen as multiple ridges in the actions of the axisymmetric\nbackground potential of the Galaxy. These ridges are probably related to a\ncombination of effects from ongoing phase-mixing and resonances from the spiral\narms and the bar. We have recently developed a method to capture the behaviour\nof the stellar phase-space distribution function at a resonance, by\nre-expressing it in terms of a new set of canonical actions and angles\nvariables valid in the resonant region. Here, by properly treating the\ndistribution function at resonances, and by using a realistic model for a\nslowly rotating large Galactic bar with pattern speed 39 km/s/kpc, we show that\nno less than six ridges in local action space can be related to resonances with\nthe bar. Two of these at low angular momentum correspond to the corotation\nresonance, and can be associated to the Hercules moving group in local velocity\nspace. Another one at high angular momentum corresponds to the outer Lindblad\nresonance, and can tentatively be associated to the velocity structure seen as\nan arch at high azimuthal velocities in Gaia data. The other ridges are\nassociated to the 3:1, 4:1 and 6:1 resonances. The latter can be associated to\nthe so-called 'horn' of the local velocity distribution. While it is clear that\neffects from spiral arms and incomplete phase-mixing related to external\nperturbations also play a role in shaping the complex kinematics revealed by\nGaia data, the present work demonstrates that, contrary to common\nmisconceptions, the bar alone can create multiple prominent ridges in velocity\nand action space.</td>

We use globular clusters beyond 15kpc to estimate the CMP of the MW,\nassuming a total gravitational potential model $\Phi(r) =\n\Phi_{\circ}r^{-\gamma}$, which approximates an NFW-type potential at large\ndistances when $\gamma=0.5$. We compare the resulting CMPs given data sets (1)\nand (2), and find the results to be nearly identical. The median estimate for\nthe total mass is $M_{200}= 0.70 \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ and the $50\%$\nBayesian credible interval is $(0.62, 0.81)\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$. However,\nbecause the Vasiliev catalog contains more complete data at large $r$, the MW\ntotal mass is slightly more constrained by these data. In this work, we also\nsupply instructions for how to create a CMP for the MW with Bayesian credible\nregions, given a model for $M(<r)$ and samples drawn from a posterior\ndistribution. With the CMP, we can report median estimates and $50\%$ Bayesian\ncredible regions for the MW mass within any distance (e.g., $M(r=25\text{kpc})=\n0.26~(0.20, 0.36)\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$, $M(r=50\text{kpc})= 0.37~(0.29, 0.51)\n\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$, $M(r=100\text{kpc}) = 0.53~(0.41, 0.74)\n\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$, etc.), making it easy to compare our results directly\nto other studies.</td>

      <td>Stars that Move Together Were Born Together</td>
      <td>It is challenging to reliably identify stars that were born together outside\nof actively star-forming regions and bound stellar systems. However, co-natal\nstars should be present throughout the Galaxy, and their demographics can shed\nlight on the clustered nature of star formation and the dynamical state of the\ndisk. In previous work we presented a set of simulations of the Galactic disk\nthat followed the clustered formation and dynamical evolution of 4 billion\nindividual stars over the last 5 Gyr. The simulations predict that a high\nfraction of co-moving stars with physical and 3D velocity separation of $\Delta\nr < 20$ pc and $\Delta v < 1.5$ km s$^{-1}$ are co-natal. In this\n\textit{Letter}, we use \textit{Gaia} DR2 and LAMOST DR4 data to identify and\nstudy co-moving pairs. We find that the distribution of relative velocities and\nseparations of pairs in the data is in good agreement with the predictions from\nthe simulation. We identify 111 co-moving pairs in the Solar neighborhood with\nreliable astrometric and spectroscopic measurements. These pairs show a strong\npreference for having similar metallicities when compared to random field\npairs. We therefore conclude that these pairs were very likely born together.\nThe simulations predict that co-natal pairs originate preferentially from\nhigh-mass and relatively young ($< 1$ Gyr) star clusters. \textit{Gaia} will\neventually deliver well-determined metallicities for the brightest stars,\nenabling the identification of thousands of co-natal pairs due to disrupting\nstar clusters in the solar neighborhood.</td>

      <td>[ABRIDGED] The purpose of this work is to evaluate how several elements\nproduced by different nucleosynthesis processes behave with stellar age and\nprovide empirical relations to derive stellar ages from chemical abundances. We\nderive different sets of ages using Gaia parallaxes for a sample of more than\n1000 FGK dwarf stars for which he have spectra from the HARPS-GTO program. We\nanalyze the temporal evolution of different abundance ratios to find the best\nchemical clocks. We find that [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio (average of Mg, Si and Ti),\n[O/Fe] and [Zn/Fe] are good age proxies with a lower dispersion than the\nage-metallicity dispersion. Several abundance ratios present a significant\ncorrelation with age for chemically separated thin disk stars (i.e.\nlow-$\alpha$) but in the case of the chemically defined thick disk stars (i.e.\nhigh-$\alpha$) only the elements Mg, Si, Ca and TiII show a clear correlation\nwith age. We find that the thick disk stars are more enriched in light-s\nelements than thin disk stars of similar age. The maximum enrichment of\ns-process elements in the thin disk occurs in the youngest stars which in turn\nhave solar metallicity. The slopes of the [X/Fe]-age relations are quite\nconstant for O, Mg, Si, Ti, Zn, Sr and Eu regardless of the metallicity.\nHowever, this is not the case for Al, Ca, Cu and most of the s-process\nelements, which display very different trends depending on the metallicity.\nThis demonstrates the limitations of using simple linear relations based on\ncertain abundance ratios to obtain ages for stars of different metallicities.\nFinally, we show that by using 3D relations with a chemical clock and two\nstellar parameters (either Teff, [Fe/H] or stellar mass) we can explain up to\n89% of age variance in a star. A similar result is obtained when using 2D\nrelations with a chemical clock and one stellar parameter, being up to a 87% of\nthe variance explained.</td>

      <td>Large spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way have revealed that a small\npopulation of stars in the halo have light element abundances comparable to\nthose found in globular clusters. The favoured explanation for the peculiar\nabundances of these stars is that they originated inside a globular cluster and\nwere subsequently lost. Using orbit calculations we assess the likelihood that\nan existing sample of 57 field stars with globular cluster-like CN band\nstrength originated in any of the currently known Milky Way globular clusters.\nUsing Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Gaia data, we determine orbits and integrals\nof motion of our sample of field stars, and use these values and metallicity to\nidentify likely matches to globular clusters. The pivot hypothesis is that had\nthese stars been stripped from such objects, they would have remained on very\nsimilar orbits. We find that ~ 70% of the sample of field stars have orbital\nproperties consistent with the halo of the Milky Way; however, only 20 stars\nhave likely orbital associations with an existing globular cluster. The\nremaining ~ 30% of the sample have orbits that place them in the outer Galactic\ndisc. No cluster of similar metallicity is known on analogous disc orbits. The\norbital properties of the halo stars seem to be compatible with the globular\ncluster escapee scenario. The stars in the outer disc are particularly\nsurprising and deserve further investigation to establish their nature.</td>

      <td>Sharpless 269 (S269) is one of a few HII regions in the outer spiral arm of\nthe Milky Way with strong water maser emission. Based on data from the Very\nLong Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA)\narray, two parallax measurements have been published, which differ by nearly\n$2\sigma$. Each distance estimate supports a different structure for the outer\narm. Moreover, given its large Galactocentric radii, S269 has special relevance\nas its proper motion and parallax have been used to constrain the Galactic\nrotation curve at large radii. Using recent Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)\nobservations, we accurately measure the parallax and proper motion of the water\nmasers in S269. We interpret the position and motion of S269 in the context of\nGalactic structure, and possible optical counterparts. S269's 22 GHz water\nmasers and two close-by quasars were observed at 16 epochs between 2015 and\n2016 using the VLBA. We measure an annual parallax for S269 of 0.241 $\pm$\n0.012 mas corresponding to a distance from the Sun of $4.15^{+0.22}_{-0.20}$\nkpc by fitting four maser spots. The mean proper motion for S269 was estimated\nas $0.16\pm0.26$ mas $\rm{yr^{-1}}$ and $-0.51\pm0.26$ mas $\rm{yr^{-1}}$ for\n$\mu_{\alpha} \ cos \delta$ and $\mu_{\delta}$ respectively, which corresponds\nto the motion expected for a flat Galactic rotation curve at large radius. This\ndistance estimate, Galactic kinematic simulations and observations of other\nmassive young stars in the outer region support the existence of a kink in the\nouter arm at $l \approx$ 140 degrees. Additionally, we find more than 2,000\noptical sources in the Gaia DR2 catalog within 125 pc radius around the 3D\nposition of the water maser emission; from those only three sources are likely\nmembers of the same stellar association that contains the young massive star\nresponsible for the maser emission (S269 IRS 2w).</td>

      <td>The Galactic disc phase spirals at different Galactic positions revealed by Gaia and LAMOST data</td>
      <td>We have investigated the distributions of stellar azimuthal and radial\nvelocity components $V_{\Phi}$ and $V_{R}$ in the vertical position-velocity\nplane $Z$-$V_{Z}$ across the Galactic disc of $6.34 \lesssim R \lesssim\n12.34$\,kpc and $|\Phi| \lesssim 7.5^{\circ}$ using a Gaia and Gaia-LAMOST\nsample of stars. As found in previous works, the distributions exhibit\nsignificant spiral patterns. The $V_{R}$ distributions also show clear\nquadrupole patterns, which are the consequence of the well-known tilt of the\nvelocity ellipsoid. The observed spiral and quadrupole patterns in the phase\nspace plane vary strongly with radial and azimuthal positions. The phase\nspirals of $V_{\Phi}$ become more and more relaxed as $R$ increases. The spiral\npatterns of $V_{\Phi}$ and $V_{R}$ and the quadrupole patterns of $V_{R}$ are\nstrongest at $-2^{\circ} < \Phi < 2^{\circ}$ but negligible at $4^{\circ} <\n\Phi < 6^{\circ}$ and $-6^{\circ} < \Phi < -4^{\circ}$. Our results suggest an\nexternal origin of the phase spirals. In this scenario, the intruder, most\nlikely the previously well-known Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, passed through the\nGalactic plane in the direction towards either Galactic center or anti-center.\nThe azimuthal variations of the phase spirals also help us constrain the\npassage duration of the intruder. A detailed model is required to reproduce the\nobserved radial and azimuthal variations of the phase spirals of $V_{\Phi}$ and\n$V_{R}$.</td>

      <td>We report on the very low $\alpha$-element abundances of a group of\nmetal-poor stars with high orbital energy and with large retrograde motion in\nthe Milky Way halo, whose excess has been reported recently from metallicity\nand kinematics. We constructed a sample of halo stars with measured abundances\nand precise kinematics, including $\sim 880$ stars with [{{Fe}/{H}}]$<-0.7$, by\ncrossmatching the Stellar Abundances for Galactic Archaeology database to the\nsecond data release of Gaia. Three regions in the energy-angular momentum space\nhave been selected: innermost halo, Gaia Enceladus/Sausage, and high-energy\nretrograde halo. While the innermost halo and Gaia Enceladus regions have\nchemical abundances consistent with high- and low-$\alpha$ populations in the\nhalo, respectively, chemical abundances of stars in the high-energy retrograde\nhalo are different from the two populations; their [{X}/{Fe}], where X\nrepresents Na, Mg, and Ca, are even lower than those in Gaia Enceladus. These\nabundances, as well as their low mean metallicity, provide a new support for\nthe idea that the retrograde component is dominated by an accreted dwarf galaxy\nwhich has a longer star formation timescale and is less massive than Gaia\nEnceladus/Sausage.</td>

      <td>Gaia DR2 reveals a star formation burst in the disc 2-3 Gyr ago</td>
      <td>We use Gaia DR2 magnitudes, colours and parallaxes for stars with G<12 to\nexplore a 15-dimensional space that includes simultaneously the initial mass\nfunction (IMF) and a non-parametric star formation history (SFH) for the\nGalactic disc. This inference is performed by combining the Besancon Galaxy\nModel fast approximate simulations (BGM FASt) and an approximate Bayesian\ncomputation algorithm. We find in Gaia DR2 data an imprint of a star formation\nburst 2-3 Gyr ago, in the Galactic thin disc domain, and a present star\nformation rate (SFR) of about 1 Msun. Our results show a decreasing trend of\nthe SFR from 9-10 Gyr to 6-7 Gyr ago. This is consistent with the cosmological\nstar formation quenching observed at redshifts z<1.8. This decreasing trend is\nfollowed by a SFR enhancement starting at about 5 Gyr ago and continuing until\nabout 1 Gyr ago which is detected with high statistical significance by\ndiscarding the null hypothesis of an exponential SFH with a p-value=0.002. We\nestimate, from our best fit model, that about the 50% of the mass used to\ngenerate stars, along the thin disc life, was expended in the period from 5 to\n1 Gyr ago. The timescale and the amount of stellar mass generated during the\nSFR enhancement event lead us to hypothesise that its origin, currently under\ninvestigation, is not intrinsic to the disc. Thus, an external perturbation is\nneeded for its explanation. Additionally we find, for the thin disc, a slope of\nthe IMF of $\alpha_3 \approx 2$ for masses M>1.53 Msun and $\alpha_2 \approx\n1.3$ for the mass range between 0,5 and 1,53 Msun. This is the first time that\nwe consider a non-parametric SFH for the thin disc in the Besancon Galaxy\nModel. This new step, together with the capabilities of the Gaia DR2 parallaxes\nto break degeneracies between different stellar populations, allow us to better\nconstrain the SFH and the IMF.</td>

The SED of NH 84 reveals the\npresence of a hot companion to the BSS. The temperature and radius of the BSS\n(T$_{\mathrm{eff}} = 8000^{+1000}_{-250}$ K, R/R$_\odot = 1.44 \pm 0.05$)\nderived from Gemini spectra and SED fitting using Kurucz atmospheric models are\nconsistent with each other. The temperature and radius of the hotter companion\nof NH 84 (T$_{\mathrm{eff}} = 32,000 \pm 2000$ K, R/R$_\odot = 0.021 \pm\n0.007$) derived by fitting Koester WD models to the SED suggest that it is\nlikely to be a hot WD. The radial velocity derived from the spectra along with\nthe proper motion from GAIA DR2 confirms NH 84 to be a kinematic member of the\ncluster. This is the second detection of a BSS-WD candidate in a GC, and the\nfirst in the outskirts of a low density GC. The location of this BSS in NGC\n5466 along with its dynamical age supports the mass-transfer pathway for BSS\nformation in low density environments.</td>

      <td>Spherical models of star clusters with potential escapers</td>
      <td>An increasing number of observations of the outer regions of globular\nclusters (GCs) have shown a flattening of the velocity dispersion profile and\nan extended surface density profile. Formation scenarios of GCs can lead to\ndifferent explanations of these peculiarities, therefore the dynamics of stars\nin the outskirts of GCs are an important tool in tracing back the evolutionary\nhistory and formation of star clusters. One possible explanation for these\nfeatures is that GCs are embedded in dark matter halos. Alternatively, these\nfeatures are the result of a population of energetically unbound stars that can\nbe spatially trapped within the cluster, known as potential escapers (PEs). We\npresent a prescription for the contribution of these energetically unbound\nmembers to a family of self-consistent, distribution function-based models,\nwhich, for brevity, we call the Spherical Potential Escapers Stitched (SPES)\nmodels. We show that, when fitting to mock data of bound and unbound stars from\nan N-body model of a tidally-limited star cluster, the SPES models correctly\nreproduce the density and velocity dispersion profiles up to the Jacobi radius,\nand they are able to recover the value of the Jacobi radius itself to within\n20%. We also provide a comparison to the number density and velocity dispersion\nprofiles of the Galactic cluster 47 Tucanae. Such a case offers a proof of\nconcept that an appropriate modelling of PEs is essential to accurately\ninterpret Gaia data in the outskirts of GCs, and, in turn, to formulate\nmeaningful present-day constraints for GC formation scenarios in the early\nuniverse.</td>

      <td>The Gravitational Force Field of the Galaxy Measured From the Kinematics of RR Lyrae in Gaia</td>
      <td>From a sample of 15651 RR Lyrae with accurate proper motions in Gaia DR2, we\nmeasure the azimuthally averaged kinematics of the inner stellar halo between\n1.5 kpc and 20 kpc from the Galactic centre. We find that their kinematics are\nstrongly radially anisotropic, and their velocity ellipsoid nearly spherically\naligned over this volume. Only in the inner regions $\lesssim$ 5 kpc does the\nanisotropy significantly fall (but still with $\beta >$ 0.25) and the velocity\nellipsoid tilt towards cylindrical alignment. In the inner regions, our sample\nof halo stars rotates at up to 50 km s$^{-1}$, which may reflect the early\nhistory of the Milky Way, although there is also significant angular momentum\nexchange with the Galactic bar at these radii. We subsequently apply the Jeans\nequations to these kinematic measurements in order to non-parametrically infer\nthe azimuthally averaged gravitational acceleration field over this volume, and\nby removing the contribution from baryonic matter, measure the contribution\nfrom dark matter. We find that the gravitational potential of the dark matter\nis nearly spherical with average flattening $q_\Phi=$ 1.01 $\pm$ 0.06 between 5\nkpc and 20 kpc, and by fitting parametric ellipsoidal density profiles to the\nacceleration field, we measure the flattening of the dark matter halo over\nthese radii to be $q_\rho=$ 1.00 $\pm$ 0.09.</td>

      <td>Using data from Gaia DR2, we study the radial number density profiles of the\nGalactic globular cluster sample. Proper motions are used for accurate\nmembership selection, especially crucial in the cluster outskirts. Due to the\nsevere crowding in the centres, the Gaia data is supplemented by literature\ndata from HST and surface brightness measurements, where available. This\nresults in 81 clusters with a complete density profile covering the full tidal\nradius (and beyond) for each cluster. We model the density profiles using a set\nof single-mass models ranging from King and Wilson models to generalised\nlowered isothermal limepy models and the recently introduced spes models, which\nallow for the inclusion of potential escapers. We find that both King and\nWilson models are too simple to fully reproduce the density profiles, with King\n(Wilson) models on average underestimating(overestimating) the radial extent of\nthe clusters. The truncation radii derived from the limepy models are similar\nto estimates for the Jacobi radii based on the cluster masses and their orbits.\nWe show clear correlations between structural and environmental parameters, as\na function of Galactocentric radius and integrated luminosity. Notably, the\nrecovered fraction of potential escapers correlates with cluster pericentre\nradius, luminosity and cluster concentration. The ratio of half mass over\nJacobi radius also correlates with both truncation parameter and PE fraction,\nshowing the effect of Roche lobe filling.</td>

      <td>We analyse the kinematics of the Galactic bar-bulge using proper motions from\nthe ESO public survey Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) and the second\nGaia data release. Gaia has provided some of the first absolute proper motions\nwithin the bulge and the near-infrared VVV multi-epoch catalogue complements\nGaia in highly-extincted low-latitude regions. We discuss the\nrelative-to-absolute calibration of the VVV proper motions using Gaia. Along\nlines of sight spanning $-10<\ell/\,\mathrm{deg}<10$ and\n$-10<b/\,\mathrm{deg}<5$, we probabilistically model the density and velocity\ndistributions as a function of distance of $\sim45$ million stars. The\ntransverse velocities confirm the rotation signature of the bar seen in\nspectroscopic surveys. The differential rotation between the double peaks of\nthe magnitude distribution confirms the X-shaped nature of the bar-bulge. Both\ntransverse velocity components increase smoothly along the near-side of the bar\ntowards the Galactic centre, peak at the Galactic centre and decline on the\nfar-side. The anisotropy is $\sigma_\ell/\sigma_b\approx1.1-1.3$ within the\nbulk of the bar, reducing to $0.9-1.1$ when rotational broadening is accounted\nfor, and exhibits a clear X-shaped signature. The vertex deviation in $\ell$\nand $b$ is significant $|\rho_{\ell b}|\lesssim0.2$, greater on the near-side\nof the bar and produces a quadrupole signature across the bulge indicating\napproximate radial alignment. We have re-constructed the 3D kinematics from the\nassumption of triaxiality, finding good agreement with spectroscopic survey\nresults. In the co-rotating frame, we find evidence of bar-supporting x1 orbits\nand tangential bias in the in-plane dispersion field.</td>

The distance to the cluster was estimated as 7.1 $\pm$ 0.1 kpc from\nindependent methods related to the variable star families RR Lyrae, SX Phe and\nW Virginis, from the luminosity of the theoretical ZAHB and from the orbit\nsolution of a newly discovered contact binary star. The RR Lyrae pulsation\nmodes are segregated by the red edge of the first overtone instability strip in\nthis OoII type cluster.

      <td>Abundances of disk and Bulge giants from high-resolution optical spectra III. Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni</td>
      <td>Context. Recent observations of the Bulge, e.g., its X-shape, cylindrical\nstellar motions, and a potential fraction of young stars propose that it formed\nthrough secular evolution of the disk and not through gas dissipation and/or\nmergers, as thought previously. Aims. We measure abundances of six iron-peak\nelements (Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co and Ni) in the local thin and thick disks as well\nas the Bulge to provide additional observational constraints for Galaxy\nformation and chemical evolution models. Methods. We use high-resolution\noptical spectra of 291 K giants in the local disk mostly obtained by the FIES\nat NOT (signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 80-100) and 45 K giants in the Bulge\nobtained by the UVES/FLAMES at VLT (S/N ratio of 10-80). We measure abundances\nin SME and apply NLTE corrections to the [Mn/Fe] and [Co/Fe] ratios. To\ndiscriminate between the thin and thick, we use stellar metallicity,\n[Ti/Fe]-ratios, and kinematics from Gaia DR2 (proper motions and the radial\nvelocities). Results. The observed disk trend of V is more enhanced in the\nthick disk, while the Co disk trend shows a minor enhancement in the thick\ndisk. The Bulge trends of V and Co appear even more enhanced w.r.t. the thick\ndisk, but within the uncertainties. The [Ni/Fe] ratio seems slightly\noverabundant in the thick disk and the Bulge w.r.t. the thin disk, although the\ndifference is minor. The disk and Bulge trends of Sc, Cr and Mn overlap\nstrongly. Conclusions. The somewhat enhanced [(V,Co)/Fe] ratios observed in the\nBulge suggest that the local thick disk and the Bulge might have experienced\ndifferent chemical enrichment and evolutionary paths. However, we are unable to\npredict the exact evolutionary path of the Bulge solely based on these\nobservations. Galactic chemical evolution models could, on the other hand,\nprovide that using these results.</td>

Our approach is to\nuse our knowledge of the assembly history and phase-space distribution of halo\nstars to constrain the form of the high velocity tail of the stellar halo.\nUsing simple analytical models and cosmological simulations, we find that the\nshape of the high velocity tail is strongly dependent on the velocity\nanisotropy and number density profile of the halo stars --- highly eccentric\norbits and/or shallow density profiles have more extended high velocity tails.\nThe halo stars in the solar vicinity are known to have a strongly radial\nvelocity anisotropy, and it has recently been shown the origin of these highly\neccentric orbits is the early accretion of a massive (M_star ~ 10^9 M_Sun)\ndwarf satellite. We use this knowledge to construct a prior on the shape of the\nhigh velocity tail. Moreover, we use the simulations to define an appropriate\nouter boundary of 2r_200, beyond which stars can escape. After applying our\nmethodology to the Gaia data, we find a local (r_0=8.3 kpc) escape speed of\nv_esc(r_0) = 528(+24,-25) km/s. We use our measurement of the escape velocity\nto estimate the total Milky Way mass, and dark halo concentration: M_200,tot =\n1.00(+0.31,-0.24) x 10^12 M_Sun, c_200 = 10.9(+4.4,-3.3).

Those parameters, all derived from Gaia DR2\nonly, were combined to provide the 6D phase space information of 861 clusters.\nThe velocity distribution of nearby clusters was investigated, as well as the\nspatial and velocity distributions of the whole sample as a function of age. A\nhigh quality subsample was used to investigate some possible pairs and groups\nof clusters sharing the same Galactic position and velocity. Results. For the\nhigh quality sample that has 406 clusters, the median uncertainty of the\nweighted mean radial velocity is 0.5 km/s. The accuracy, assessed by comparison\nto ground-based high resolution spectroscopy, is better than 1 km/s. Open\nclusters nicely follow the velocity distribution of field stars in the close\nSolar neighbourhood previously revealed by Gaia DR2. As expected, the vertical\ndistribution of young clusters is very flat but the novelty is the high\nprecision to which this can be seen. The dispersion of vertical velocities of\nyoung clusters is at the level of 5 km/s. Clusters older than 1 Gyr span\ndistances to the Galactic plane up to 1 kpc with a vertical velocity dispersion\nof 14 km/s, typical of the thin disc. Five pairs of clusters and one group with\nfive members are possibly physically related. Other binary candidates\npreviously identified turn out to be chance alignment.</td>

      <td>A Dynamical Model for Clustered Star Formation in the Galactic Disk</td>
      <td>The clustered nature of star formation should produce a high degree of\nstructure in the combined phase and chemical space in the Galactic disk. To\ndate, observed structure of this kind has been mostly limited to bound clusters\nand moving groups. In this paper we present a new dynamical model of the\nGalactic disk that takes into account the clustered nature of star formation.\nThis model predicts that the combined phase and chemical space is rich in\nsubstructure, and that this structure is sensitive to both the precise nature\nof clustered star formation and the large-scale properties of the Galaxy. The\nmodel self-consistently evolves 4 billion stars over the last 5 Gyr in a\nrealistic potential that includes an axisymmetric component, a bar, spiral\narms, and giant molecular clouds (GMCs). All stars are born in clusters with an\nobservationally-motivated range of initial conditions. As direct\n\textit{N}-body calculations for billions of stars is computationally\ninfeasible, we have developed a method of initializing star cluster particles\nto mimic the effects of direct \textit{N}-body effects, while the actual orbit\nintegrations are treated as test particles within the analytic potential. We\ndemonstrate that the combination of chemical and phase space information is\nmuch more effective at identifying truly co-natal populations than either\nchemical or phase space alone. Furthermore, we show that co-moving pairs of\nstars are very likely to be co-natal if their velocity separation is $< 2$ km\ns$^{-1}$ and their metallicity separation is $< 0.05$ dex. The results\npresented here bode well for harnessing the synergies between \textit{Gaia} and\nspectroscopic surveys to reveal the assembly history of the Galactic disk.</td>

These data provide a bridge\nbetween existing small-area, high-precision HST photometry and all\nsky-catalogues from large surveys like Gaia, SDSS, or LSST. For many clusters,\nwe present the first publicly available photometry in some of the five bands\n(typically U and R). We illustrate the scientific potential of the photometry\nwith examples of surface density and brightness profiles and of\ncolour-magnitude diagrams, with the following highlights: (i) we study the\nmorphology of NGC 5904, finding a varying ellipticity and position angle as a\nfunction of radial distance; (ii) we show U-based colour-magnitude diagrams and\ndemonstrate that no cluster in our sample is free from multiple stellar\npopulations, with the possible exception of a few clusters with high and\ndifferential reddening or field contamination, for which more sophisticated\ninvestigations are required.

      <td>A multi-messenger study of the Milky Way's stellar disc and bulge with LISA, Gaia and LSST</td>
      <td>The upcoming LISA mission offers the unique opportunity to study the Milky\nWay through gravitational wave radiation from Galactic binaries. Among the\nvariety of Galactic gravitational wave sources, LISA is expected to\nindividually resolve signals from $\sim 10^5$ ultra-compact double white dwarf\n(DWD) binaries. DWDs detected by LISA will be distributed across the Galaxy,\nincluding regions that are hardly accessible to electromagnetic observations\nsuch as the inner part of the Galactic disc, the bulge and beyond. We\nquantitatively show that the large number of DWD detections will allow us to\nuse these systems as tracers of the Milky Way potential. We demonstrate that\ndensity profiles of DWDs detected by LISA may provide constraints on the scale\nlength parameters of the baryonic components that are both accurate and\nprecise, with statistical errors of a few percent to $10$ percent level.\nFurthermore, the LISA sample is found to be sufficient to disentangle between\ndifferent (commonly used) disc profiles, by well covering the disc out to\nsufficiently large radii. Finally, up to $\sim 80$ DWDs can be detected through\nboth electromagnetic and gravitational wave radiation. This enables\nmulti-messenger astronomy with DWD binaries and allows one to extract their\nphysical properties using both probes. We show that fitting the Galactic\nrotation curve constructed using distances inferred from gravitational waves\n{\it and} proper motions from optical observations yield a unique and\ncompetitive estimate of the bulge mass. Instead robust results for the stellar\ndisc mass are contingent upon knowledge of the Dark Matter content.</td>

The repeated impacts of Sgr excite coupled vertical and\nradial oscillations in the disc which qualitatively, and to a large degree\nquantitatively are able to reproduce many features in the 6D $Gaia$ DR2\nsamples, from the median $V_{R},V_{\phi}, V_{z} $ velocity maps to the local\n$\delta\rho(v_{z},z)$ phase-space spiral which is a manifestation of the global\ndisc response to coupled oscillations within a given volume. The patterns in\nthe large-scale velocity field are well described by tightly wound spirals and\nvertical corrugations excited from Sgr's impacts. We show that the last\npericentric passage of Sgr resets the formation of the local present-day\n$\delta\rho(v_z,z)$ spiral and situate its formation around 500-800 Myr. As\nexpected $\delta\rho(vz,z)$ grows in size and decreases in woundedness as a\nfunction of radius in both the $Gaia$ DR2 data and simulations. This is the\nfirst N-body model able to explain so many of the features in the data on\ndifferent scales. We demonstrate how to use the full extent of the Galactic\ndisc to date perturbations dating from Myr to Gyr, probe the underlying\npotential and constrain the mass-loss history of Sgr. $\delta\rho(vz,z)$ looks\nthe same in all stellar populations age bins down to the youngest ages which\nrules out a bar buckling origin.</td>

      <td>Simultaneous calibration of spectro-photometric distances and the Gaia DR2 parallax zero-point offset with deep learning</td>
      <td>Gaia measures the five astrometric parameters for stars in the Milky Way, but\nonly four of them (positions and proper motion, but not parallax) are well\nmeasured beyond a few kpc from the Sun. Modern spectroscopic surveys such as\nAPOGEE cover a large area of the Milky Way disk and we can use the relation\nbetween spectra and luminosity to determine distances to stars beyond Gaia's\nparallax reach. Here, we design a deep neural network trained on stars in\ncommon between Gaia and APOGEE that determines spectro-photometric distances to\nAPOGEE stars, while including a flexible model to calibrate parallax zero-point\nbiases in Gaia DR2. We determine the zero-point offset to be $-52.3 \pm 2.0uas$\nwhen modeling it as a global constant, but also train a multivariate zero-point\noffset model that depends on $G$, $G_{BP} - G_{RP}$ color, and $T_\mathrm{eff}$\nand that can be applied to all 139 million stars in Gaia DR2 within APOGEE's\ncolor--magnitude range. Our spectro-photometric distances are more precise than\nGaia at distances $\approx 2kpc$ from the Sun. We release a catalog of\nspectro-photometric distances for the entire APOGEE DR14 data set which covers\nGalactocentric radii $2kpc\lesssim R \lesssim19kpc$; $\approx 150,000$ stars\nhave <10% uncertainty, making this a powerful sample to study the\nchemo-dynamical structure of the disk. We use this sample to map the mean\n[Fe/H] and 15 abundance ratios [X/Fe] from the Galactic center to the edge of\nthe disk. Among many interesting trends, we find that the bulge and bar region\nat $R \lesssim 5kpc$ clearly stands out in [Fe/H] and most abundance ratios.</td>

      <td>The Galactic Disc in Action Space as seen by Gaia DR2</td>
      <td>The quality and quantity of 6D stellar position-velocity measurements in the\nsecond Gaia data release (DR2) allows to study small-scale structure in the\norbit distribution of the Galactic disc beyond the immediate Solar\nneighborhood. We investigate the distribution of orbital actions\n$(J_R,J_\phi=L_z,J_z)$ of $\sim 3.5$ million stars within $1.5~\text{kpc}$ of\nthe Sun, for which precise actions can be calculated from Gaia DR2 alone. This\ndistribution $n(J_R,L_z)$ reveals a remarkable amount of sub-structure. The\nknown moving groups in the $(U,V)$-plane of the Solar neighborhood correspond\nto overdensities in $(J_R,L_z)$, as expected. But $n(J_R,L_z)$ also exhibits a\nwealth of density clumps and ridges that extend towards higher $J_R$. These\n$n(J_R,L_z)$ features are most prominent among orbits that stay close to the\nGalactic plane and remain consistently visible out to $\sim1.5~\text{kpc}$, as\nopposed to the sub-structure in velocity space. Some of these $n(J_R,L_z)$\nridges resemble features expected from rapid orbit diffusion along particular\n($J_R,L_z$)-directions in the presence of various resonances. Several of these\n$n(J_R,L_z)$ structures show a dramatic imbalance of stars moving in or out,\nsuggesting that stars are not phase-mixed along orbits or on resonant orbits.\nOrbital action and angle space of stars in Gaia DR2 is therefore highly\nstructured over kpc-scales, and appears to be very informative for modeling\nstudies of non-axisymmetric structure and resonances in the Galactic disc.</td>

Taking advantage of the Pan-STARRS PS1 public\nastrometric and photometric catalogue, we built the radial profile for the\noutermost cluster regions using horizontal branch and main sequence stars,\nseparately, in order to probe for different profile trends because of\ndifference stellar masses. Owing to its relatively close location to the\nGalactic plane, we have carefully treated the chosen colour-magnitude regions\nproperly correcting them by the amount of interstellar extinction measured\nalong the line-of-side of each star, as well as cleaned them from the variable\nfield star contamination observed across the cluster field. In the region\nspanning from the tidal to the Jacobi radii the resulting radial profiles show\na diffuse extended halo, with an average power law slope of -1. While analysing\nthe relationships between the Galactocentric distance, the half-mass density,\nthe half-light radius, the slope of the radial profile of the outermost\nregions, the internal dynamical evolutionary stage, among others, we found that\nNGC6779 shows structural properties similar to those of the remaining Gaia\nSausage candidate globular clusters, namely, they are massive clusters\n(>10^5Mo) in a moderately early dynamical evolutionary stage, with observed\nextra-tidal structures.</td>

(2018) by crossmatching their A/F sample\nwith Gaia DR2 to bring in proper motions. These are combined with the already\nmeasured radial velocities and spectro-photometric distances to obtain full\nspace motions. We use this sample of 1173 stars, located in two pencil-beam\nsightlines (l=178deg and l=118deg), to sample the Galactocentric velocity field\nout to almost R_G=15 kpc. We find there are significant differences in all\nthree (radial, azimuthal and vertical) kinematic components between the two\ndirections. The rotation curve is roughly flat in the anticentre direction,\nconfirming and extending the result of Kawata et al. (2018a) thanks to the\ngreater reach of our spectro-photometric distance scale. However at l=118deg\nthe circular velocity rises outwards from R_G=10.5 kpc and there is a more\npronounced gradient in radial motion than is seen at l=178deg. Furthermore, the\nA star radial motion differs from the F stars by ~10 km/s. We discuss our\nfindings in the context of perturbers potentially responsible for the trends,\nsuch as the central bar, spiral arms, the warp and external satellites. Our\nresults at l=178deg are broadly consistent with previous work on K giants in\nthe anticentre, but the kinematics at l=118deg in the Perseus region do not yet\nreconcile easily with bar or spiral arm perturbation.</td>

      <td>Evidence for an Intermediate-Mass Milky Way from Gaia DR2 Halo Globular Cluster Motions</td>
      <td>We estimate the mass of the Milky Way (MW) within 21.1 kpc using the\nkinematics of halo globular clusters (GCs) determined by Gaia. The second Gaia\ndata release (DR2) contained a catalogue of absolute proper motions (PMs) for a\nset of Galactic GCs and satellite galaxies measured using Gaia DR2 data. We\nselect from the catalogue only halo GCs, identifying a total of 34 GCs spanning\n$2.0 < r < 21.1$ kpc, and use their 3D kinematics to estimate the anisotropy\nover this range to be $\beta = 0.46^{+0.15}_{-0.19}$, in good agreement, though\nslightly lower than, a recent estimate for a sample of halo GCs using HST PM\nmeasurements further out in the halo. We then use the Gaia kinematics to\nestimate the mass of the MW inside the outermost GC to be $M(< 21.1\n\mathrm{kpc}) = 0.21^{+0.04}_{-0.03} 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$, which\ncorresponds to a circular velocity of $v_\mathrm{circ}(21.1 \mathrm{kpc}) =\n206^{+19}_{-16}$ km/s. The implied virial mass is $M_\mathrm{virial} =\n1.28^{+0.97}_{-0.48} 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$. The error bars encompass the\nuncertainties on the anisotropy and on the density profile of the MW dark halo,\nand the scatter inherent in the mass estimator we use. We get improved\nestimates when we combine the Gaia and HST samples to provide kinematics for 46\nGCs out to 39.5 kpc: $\beta = 0.52^{+0.11}_{-0.14}$, $M(< 39.5 \mathrm{kpc}) =\n0.42^{+0.07}_{-0.06} 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$, and $M_\mathrm{virial} =\n1.54^{+0.75}_{-0.44} 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$. We show that these results are\nrobust to potential substructure in the halo GC distribution. While a wide\nrange of MW virial masses have been advocated in the literature, from below\n$10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$ to above $2 \times 10^{12}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, these\nnew data imply that an intermediate mass is most likely.</td>

      <td>Origin of a massive hyper-runaway subgiant star LAMOST-HVS1 -- implication from Gaia and follow-up spectroscopy</td>
      <td>We report that LAMOST-HVS1 is a massive hyper-runaway subgiant star with mass\nof 8.3 Msun and super-Solar metallicity, ejected from the inner stellar disk of\nthe Milky Way $\sim$ 33 Myr ago with the intrinsic ejection velocity of\n$568^{+19}_{-17}$ km/s (corrected for the streaming motion of the disk), based\non the proper motion data from Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) and high-resolution\nspectroscopy. The extremely large ejection velocity indicates that this star\nwas not ejected by the supernova explosion of the binary companion. Rather, it\nwas probably ejected by a 3- or 4-body dynamical interaction with more massive\nobjects in a high-density environment. Such a high-density environment may be\nattained at the core region of a young massive cluster with mass of $\gtrsim\n10^4$ Msun. The ejection agent that took part in the ejection of LAMOST-HVS1\nmay well be an intermediate mass black hole ($\gtrsim$ 100 Msun), a very\nmassive star ($\gtrsim$ 100 Msun), or multiple ordinary massive stars\n($\gtrsim$ 30 Msun). Based on the flight time and the ejection location of\nLAMOST-HVS1, we argue that its ejection agent or its natal star cluster is\ncurrently located near the Norma spiral arm. The natal star cluster of\nLAMOST-HVS1 may be an undiscovered young massive cluster near the Norma spiral\narm.</td>

      <td>Measuring the local matter density using Gaia DR2</td>
      <td>We determine the total dynamical matter density in the solar neighbourhood\nusing the second Gaia data release (DR2). The dynamical matter density\ndistribution is inferred in a framework of a Bayesian hierarchical model, which\naccounts for position and velocity of all individual stars, as well as the full\nerror covariance matrix of astrometric observables, in a joint fit of the\nvertical velocity distribution and stellar number density distribution. This\nwas done for eight separate data samples, with different cuts in observed\nabsolute magnitude, each containing about 25,000 stars. The model for the total\nmatter density does not rely on any underlying baryonic model, although we\nassumed that it is symmetrical, smooth, and monotonically decreasing with\ndistance from the mid-plane. We infer a density distribution which is strongly\npeaked in the region close to the Galactic plane ($\lesssim 60$ pc), for all\neight stellar samples. Assuming a baryonic model and a dark matter halo of\nconstant density, this corresponds to a surplus surface density of\napproximately 5--9 M$_\odot$/pc$^2$. For the Sun's position and vertical\nvelocity with respect to the Galactic plane, we infer $Z_\odot = 4.76\pm 2.27$\npc and $W_\odot = 7.24\pm 0.19$ km/s. These results suggest a surplus of matter\nclose to the Galactic plane, possibly explained by an underestimated density of\ncold gas. We discuss possible systematic effects that could bias our result,\nfor example unmodelled non-equilibrium effects, and how to account for such\neffects in future extensions of this work.</td>

      <td>With about 12 000 OB type stars selected from the LAMOST and Gaia survey, we\nstudy their 3 dimensional velocity distribution over the range of\ngalactocentric radius from 6 to 15 kpc in the Galactic disk plane. A clear\nripple pattern in the radial velocity ($V_R$) map is shown. The median $V_R$\nreaches $-8$ km s$^{-1}$ at $R\sim9$ kpc, then increases to $\sim0$ km s$^{-1}$\nat $R\sim12$ kpc, and later declines to below $-10$ km s$^{-1}$ beyond\n$R\sim13$ kpc. The median azimuthal velocity ($V_\phi$) map shows a similar\npattern but has roughly $1/4$ phase difference with the radial velocity.\nAlthough the ripple of negative $V_R$ at $\sim9$ kpc extends to about\n40$^\circ$ in the azimuth angle, it does not align with either the Local or the\nPerseus spiral arm. Moreover, the farther ripple beyond 13 kpc does not match\nthe Outer spiral arm either. This indicates that the non-axisymmetric kinematic\nfeatures are not induced by perturbations of known spiral structures. The\ncentral rotating bar can not lead to such patterns in the outer disk either.\nExternal perturbation of a dwarf galaxy or a dark matter sub-halo can induce\nsuch patterns but requires more evidence from both observations and\nsimulations. The $V_\phi$ map in the $Z$--$V_Z$ plane of the OB stars is also\ninvestigated. Despite asymmetry to some degree, no spiral pattern is found.\nThis is reasonable since most of the OB stars have ages much younger than 100\nMyrs, which is smaller than one orbital period around the Galactic center.</td>

In this 2-dimensional space, the orbital properties of satellite galaxies\nvary according to the host halo mass. The halo mass can be inferred by\ncalculating the likelihood that the observed satellite population is drawn from\nthis DF. Our method is robustly calibrated on mock EAGLE systems. We validate\nit by applying it to the completely independent suite of 30 AURIGA\nhigh-resolution simulations of MW-like galaxies: the method accurately recovers\ntheir true mass and associated uncertainties. We then apply it to ten classical\nsatellites of the MW with 6D phase-space measurements, including updated proper\nmotions from the GAIA satellite. The mass of the MW is estimated to be\n$M_{200}^{\textnormal{MW}}=1.17_{-0.15}^{+0.21}\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$ (68\%\nconfidence limits). We combine our total mass estimate with recent mass\nestimates in the inner regions of the Galaxy to infer an inner dark matter (DM)\nmass fraction $M^\textnormal{DM}(<20~\rm{kpc})/M^\textnormal{DM}_{200}=0.12$\nwhich is typical of ${\sim}10^{12}M_{\odot}$ $\Lambda$CDM haloes in\nhydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations.

We measure the velocity dispersion for all three\ncomponents (vertical, radial, and tangential) and find that it varies smoothly\nwith [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] for each component. The vertical component is\nespecially clean, with $\sigma_{v_z}$ increasing from a low of $8$ km s$^{-1}$\nat solar-[$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H] to a high of more than 50 km s$^{-1}$ for\nmore metal-poor and [$\alpha$/Fe] enhanced populations. We find no evidence of\na large decrease in the velocity dispersion of the higher-[$\alpha$/Fe]\npopulations as claimed in analysis prior to Gaia DR2, although the trend of\nincreasing velocity dispersion with [$\alpha$/Fe] for the same metallicity does\nsignificantly flatten at high-[$\alpha$/Fe]. The eccentricity distribution for\nlocal stars varies most strongly as a function of [$\alpha$/Fe], where stars\nwith [$\alpha$/Fe]$<0.1$ dex having generally circular orbits ($e<0.15$), while\nthe median eccentricity increases rapidly for more [$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced\nstellar populations up to $e\sim0.35$. These [$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced populations\nhave guiding radii consistent with origins in the inner Galaxy. Of the stars\nwith metallicities much higher than the local ISM ([Fe/H]>0.1 dex), we find\nthat more than 70\% have $e<0.2$ and are likely observed in the solar\nneighbourhood through churning/migration rather than blurring effects, as the\nepicyclic motion for these stars is not large enough to reach the radii at\nwhich they were likely born based on their metallicity.</td>

Assuming that these stars are old ($>11\Gyr$) and that they are\nexpected to belong to the Milky Way halo, we find that these 42 stars (18 dwarf\nstars and 24 giants or sub-giants) are currently within $\sim20\kpc$ of the Sun\nand that they map a wide variety of orbits. A large fraction of those stars\nremains confined to the inner parts of the halo and was likely formed or\naccreted early on in the history of the Milky Way, while others have larger\napocentres ($>30\kpc$), hinting at later accretion from dwarf galaxies. Of\nparticular interest, we find evidence that a significant fraction of all known\nUMP stars ($\sim26$\%) are on prograde orbits confined within $3\kpc$ of the\nMilky Way plane ($J_z < 100 \kms \kpc$). One intriguing interpretation is that\nthese stars belonged to the massive building block(s) of the proto-Milky Way\nthat formed the backbone of the Milky Way disc. Alternatively, they might have\nformed in the early disc and have been dynamically heated, or have been brought\ninto the Milky Way by one or more accretion events whose orbit was dragged into\nthe plane by dynamical friction before disruption.

The RGB stars are distinguished from the\nred clump stars utilizing period spacing derived from the spectra with a\nmachine learning method based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA).\nCross-validation suggests our method is capable of distinguishing RC from RGB\nstars with only 2 per cent contamination rate for stars with signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) higher than 50. The age and mass of these RGB stars are determined\nfrom their LAMOST spectra with KPCA method by taking the LAMOST - $Kepler$\ngiant stars having asteroseismic parameters and the LAMOST-TGAS sub-giant stars\nbased on isochrones as training sets. Examinations suggest that the age and\nmass estimates of our RGB sample stars with SNR $>$ 30 have a median error of\n30 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. Stellar ages are found to exhibit\npositive vertical and negative radial gradients across the disk, and the age\nstructure of the disk is strongly flared across the whole disk of\n$6<R<13$\,kpc. The data set demonstrates good correlations among stellar age,\n[Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe]. There are two separate sequences in the [Fe/H] --\n[$\alpha$/Fe] plane: a high--$\alpha$ sequence with stars older than\n$\sim$\,8\,Gyr and a low--$\alpha$ sequence composed of stars with ages\ncovering the whole range of possible ages of stars. We also examine relations\nbetween age and kinematic parameters derived from the Gaia DR2 parallax and\nproper motions. Both the median value and dispersion of the orbital\neccentricity are found to increase with age. The vertical angular momentum is\nfound to fairly smoothly decrease with age from 2 to 12\,Gyr, with a rate of\nabout $-$50\,kpc\,km\,s$^{-1}$\,Gyr$^{-1}$.

We study the\ndistribution of stars in the zV_z phase plane, for both V_phi and V_R, and\nrecover the remarkable "phase spiral" discovered by Gaia. We identify the\nanticipated quadrupole signature in zV_z of a tilted velocity ellipsoid for\nstars above and below the Galactic plane. By connecting our work with earlier\nstudies, we show that the phase spiral is likely to extend well beyond the\nnarrow solar neighbourhood cylinder in which it was found. The phase spiral is\na signature of corrugated waves that propagate through the disc, and the\nassociated non-equilibrium phase mixing. The radially asymmetric distribution\nof stars involved in the phase spiral reveals that the corrugation, which is\nmostly confined to the alpha-poor disc, grows in z-amplitude with increasing\nradius. We present new simulations of tidal disturbance of the Galactic disc by\nthe Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf. The effect on the zV_z phase plane lasts >2 Gyr\nbut a subsequent disc crossing wipes out the coherent structure.

      <td>Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars span a wide range of stellar\npopulations, from bona fide second-generation stars to later forming stars that\nprovide excellent probes of, e.g., binary mass transfer. Here we analyse 11\nmetal-poor stars of which 10 are CEMP stars. Based on high signal-to-noise\n(SNR) X-Shooter spectra, we derive abundances of 20 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg,\nCa, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Y, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu). From the high SNR\nspectra, we trace the chemical contribution of the rare earth elements (REE)\nfrom various production sites, finding a preference for metal-poor low-mass AGB\nstars of 1.5Mo in CEMP-s stars, while CEMP-r/s stars may indicate a more\nmassive AGB contribution (2-5Mo). A contribution from the r-process - possibly\nfrom neutron star mergers (NSM), is also detectable in the REE abundances,\nespecially in the CEMP-r/s. Combining spectra with Gaia DR2 astrometric data\nindicates that all but one star in our sample (and most literature stars)\nbelong to the Galactic halo. They exhibit a median orbital eccentricity of 0.7,\nand are found on both pro- and retrograde orbits. The orbital parameters of\nCEMP-no and CEMP4s stars are remarkably similar in the 98 stars we study. A\nspecial CEMP-no star, with very low Sr and Ba content, possesses the most\neccentric orbit among the stars in our sample, passing close to the Galactic\ncentre. Finally, we propose an improved scheme to sub-classify the CEMP stars,\nmaking use of the Sr$/$Ba ratio, which can also be used to separate very\nmetal-poor stars from CEMP stars in 93 stars in the metallicity range\n$-4.2<$[Fe/H]$<-2$. The Sr/Ba ratio can also be used for distinguishing\nCEMP-s,-r/s and -no stars. The Sr/Ba ratio is also a powerful astro-nuclear\nindicator, as AGB stars exhibit very different Sr/Ba ratios, compared to fast\nrotating massive stars and NSM, and it is fairly unbiased by NLTE and 3D\ncorrections.(abridged)</td>

The $UW$\ncomponents agree with studies based on main sequence stars, however the $V$\ncomponent differs and may be affected by systematics arising from metallicity\ngradients in the disc. The velocity ellipsoid is shown to vary strongly with\nmagnitude, and exhibits a significant vertex deviation in the $UV$ plane of\naround 15 degrees, due to the non-axisymmetric Galactic potential.\n  The results of this study provide an important input to proper motion surveys\nfor white dwarfs, which require knowledge of the velocity distribution in order\nto correct for missing low velocity stars that are culled from the sample to\nreduce subdwarf contamination.</td>

      <td>Proper motions and dynamics of the Milky Way globular cluster system from Gaia DR2</td>
      <td>We use Gaia Data Release 2 to determine the mean proper motions for 150 Milky\nWay globular clusters (almost the entire known population), with a typical\nuncertainty of 0.05 mas/yr limited mainly by systematic errors. Combining them\nwith distance and line-of-sight velocity measurements from the literature, we\nanalyze the distribution of globular clusters in the 6d phase space, using both\nposition/velocity and action/angle coordinates. The population of clusters in\nthe central 10 kpc has a mean rotational velocity reaching 50-80 km/s, and a\nnearly isotropic velocity dispersion 100-120 km/s, while in the outer galaxy\nthe cluster orbits are strongly radially anisotropic. We confirm a\nconcentration of clusters at high radial action in the outer region of the\nGalaxy. Finally, we explore a range of equilibrium distribution function-based\nmodels for the entire globular cluster system, and the information they provide\nabout the potential of the Milky Way. The dynamics of clusters is best\ndescribed by models with the circular velocity between 10 and 50 kpc staying in\nthe range 210-240 km/s.</td>

      <td>HP$\,$1 is an $\alpha$-enhanced and moderately metal-poor bulge globular\ncluster with a blue horizontal branch. These combined characteristics make it a\nprobable relic of the early star formation in the innermost Galactic regions.\nHere we present a detailed analysis of a deep near-infrared (NIR) photometry of\nHP$\,$1 obtained with the NIR GSAOI+GeMS camera at the Gemini-South telescope.\n$J$ and $K_{\rm S}$ images were collected with an exquisite spatial resolution\n(FWHM $\sim 0.1$ arcsec), reaching stars at two magnitudes below the MSTO. We\ncombine our GSAOI data with archival F606W-filter $HST$ ACS/WFC images to\ncompute relative proper motions and select bona fide cluster members. Results\nfrom statistical isochrone fits in the NIR and optical-NIR colour-magnitude\ndiagrams indicate an age of $12.8^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ Gyr, confirming that HP$\,$1\nis one of the oldest clusters in the Milky Way. The same fits also provide\napparent distance moduli in the $K_{\rm S}$ and $V$ filters in very good\nagreement with the ones from 11 RR Lyrae stars. By subtracting the extinction\nin each filter, we recover a heliocentric distance of $6.59^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$\nkpc. Furthermore, we refine the orbit of HP$\,$1 using this accurate distance\nand update and accurate radial velocities (from high resolution spectroscopy)\nand absolute proper motions (from Gaia DR2), reaching mean perigalactic and\napogalactic distances of $\sim$0.12 and $\sim$3 kpc respectively.</td>

A\ndiscrepancy of a factor of ~2 exists in the literature in regards to the\ndistance determination of these clusters. We revisit the colour-magnitude\ndiagrams (CMDs) of these two globular clusters with the purpose of\ndisentangling their distance determination ambiguity and, for the first time,\nof determining their orbits to identify whether or not they are part of the\nbulge/bar region. We use Hubble Space Telescope CMDs, with the filters F606W\nfrom ACS and F160W from WFC3 for Terzan 10, and F606W and F814W from ACS for\nDjorgosvski~1, and combine them with the proper motions from Gaia Date Release\n2.

We obtain reliable distances of dSun = 10.3+-1.0 kpc and 9.3+-0.5 kpc\nfor Terzan 10, and Djorgovski 1 respectively, indicating that they are both\ncurrently located in the bulge volume. From Gaia DR 2 proper motions, together\nwith our new distance determination and recent literature radial velocities, we\nare able to show that the two sample clusters have typical halo orbits that are\npassing by the bulge/bar region, but that they are not part of this component.\nFor the first time, halo intruders are identified in the bulge.</td>

We present\nMagellan/IMACS spectra of candidate member stars in both objects. We identify\n37 members of Crater II, 25 of which have velocity measurements in the\nliterature, and we classify 3 stars within that subset as possible binaries. We\nfind that including or removing these binary candidates does not change the\nderived velocity dispersion of Crater II. Excluding the binary candidates, we\nmeasure a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{V_{los}} = 2.7^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ \kms,\ncorresponding to $M/L = 47^{+17}_{-13}$ M$_{\odot}/$L$_{\odot}$. We measure a\nmean metallicity of [Fe/H] = $-1.95^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, with a dispersion of\n$\sigma_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}} = 0.18^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$. Our velocity dispersion and\nmetallicity measurements agree with previous measurements for Crater II, and\nconfirm that the galaxy resides in a kinematically cold dark matter halo. We\nalso search for spectroscopic members stripped from Hercules in the possible\nextratidal stellar overdensities surrounding the dwarf. For both galaxies, we\ncalculate proper motions using \textit{Gaia} DR2 astrometry, and use their full\n6D phase space information to evaluate the probability that their orbits\napproach sufficiently close to the Milky Way to experience tidal stripping.\nGiven the available kinematic data, we find a probability of $\sim$40% that\nHercules has suffered tidal stripping. The proper motion of Crater II makes it\nalmost certain to be stripped.</td>

Large and small catalogs,\nas well as papers on individual objects have been systematically\ncross-identified.

The present focus is not to compile or\ndetermine fundamental parameters, but to provide a catalog characterizing\nuniformly the entries. A major result is that now 4060 embedded clusters are\ncatologed, a factor of $\approx2$ larger than open clusters. Besides\ncross-identifications in different references and wavelength domains, we also\ncommunicate the discovery of 638 star clusters and alike objects.

      <td>We estimate the mass of the inner ($<20$ kpc) Milky Way and the axis ratio of\nits dark matter halo using globular clusters as tracers. At the same time, we\nconstrain the phase-space distribution of the globular cluster system. We use\nthe Gaia DR2 catalogue of 75 globular clusters' proper motions and recent\nmeasurements of the proper motions of another 20 distant clusters obtained with\nthe Hubble Space Telescope. We describe the globular cluster system with a\n2-component distribution function (DF), with a flat, rotating disc and a\nrounder, more extended halo. While fixing the Milky Way's disc and bulge, we\nlet the mass and shape of the dark matter halo and we fit these two parameters,\ntogether with other six describing the DF, with a Bayesian method. We find the\nmass of the Galaxy within 20 kpc to be $M(<20{\,\rm kpc})=1.91^{+0.18}_{-0.17}\n\times 10^{11} M_\odot$, of which $M_{\rm DM}(<20{\,\rm\nkpc})=1.37^{+0.18}_{-0.17}\times 10^{11}M_\odot$ is in dark matter, and the\ndensity axis ratio of the dark matter halo to be $q=1.30 \pm 0.25$. This\nimplies a virial mass $M_{\rm via} = 1.3 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$. Our\nanalysis rules out oblate ($q<0.8$) and strongly prolate halos ($q>1.9$) with\n99\% probability. Our preferred model reproduces well the observed phase-space\ndistribution of globular clusters and has a disc component that closely\nresembles that of the Galactic thick disc. The halo component follows a\npower-law density profile $\rho \propto r^{-3.3}$, has a mean rotational\nvelocity of $V_{\rm rot}\simeq -14\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ at 20 kpc, and has a mildly\nradially biased velocity distribution ($\beta\simeq 0.2 \pm 0.07$, fairly\nconstant outside 15 kpc). We also find that our distinction between disc and\nhalo clusters resembles, although not fully, the observed distinction in\nmetal-rich ([Fe/H]$>-0.8$) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\leq-0.8$) cluster\npopulations.</td>

      <td>Actions are weak stellar age indicators in the Milky Way disk</td>
      <td>The orbital properties of stars in the disk are signatures of their\nformation, but they are also expected to change over time due to the dynamical\nevolution of the Galaxy. Stellar orbits can be quantified by three dynamical\nactions, J_r, L_z, and J_z, which provide measures of the orbital eccentricity,\nguiding radius, and non-planarity, respectively. Changes in these dynamical\nactions over time reflect the strength and efficiency of the evolutionary\nprocesses that drive stellar redistributions. We examine how dynamical actions\nof stars are correlated with their age using two samples of stars with\nwell-determined ages: 78 solar twin stars (with ages to ~5%) and 4376 stars\nfrom the APOKASC2 sample (~20%). We compute actions using spectroscopic radial\nvelocities from previous surveys and parallax and proper motion measurements\nfrom Gaia DR2. We find weak gradients in all actions with stellar age, of (7.51\n+/- 0.52, -29.0 +/- 1.83, 1.54 +/- 0.18) kpc km/s/Gyr for J_r, L_z, and J_z,\nrespectively. There is, however, significant scatter in the action-age\nrelation. We caution that our results will be affected by the restricted\nspatial extent of our sample, particularly in the case of J_z. Nevertheless,\nthese action-age gradients and their associated variances provide strong\nconstraints on the efficiency of the mechanisms that drive the redistribution\nof stellar orbits over time and demonstrate that actions are informative as to\nstellar age. The shallow action-age gradients combined with the large\ndispersion in each action at a given age, however, renders the prospect of age\ninference from orbits of individual stars bleak. Using the precision\nmeasurements of [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] for our stars we investigate the\nabundance-action relationship and find weak correlations. Similar to our\nstellar age results, dynamical actions afford little discriminating power\nbetween low- and high-$\alpha$ stars.</td>

The star redward of the instability strip also exhibits\nsignificant multi-periodic variability at lower frequencies.

The surface\nabundances of these chemical species are well-known to change in stars during\ntheir evolution on the red giant branch after the first dredge-up episod, as a\nresult of extra-mixing phenomena. We investigate the effects of thermohaline\nmixing on C and N abundances using the first comparison between the GES [C/N]\ndeterminations with simulations of the observed fields using a model of stellar\npopulation synthesis. We explore the effects of thermohaline mixing on the\nchemical properties of giants through stellar evolutionary models computed with\nthe stellar evolution code STAREVOL. We include these stellar evolution models\nin the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy model to simulate the [C/N] distributions determined\nfrom the UVES spectra of the GES and compare them with the observations.\nTheoretical predictions including the effect of thermohaline mixing are in good\nagreement with the observations. However, the field stars in the GES with C and\nN-abundance measurements have a metallicity close to solar, where the\nefficiency of thermohaline mixing is not very large. The C and N abundances\nderived by the GES in open and globular clusters clearly show the impact of\nthermohaline mixing at low-metallicity, allowing to explain the [C/N] ratio\nobserved in lower-mass and older giant stars. Using independent observations of\ncarbon isotopic ratio in clump field stars and open clusters, we also confirm\nthat thermohaline mixing should be taken into account to explain the behavior\nof 12C/13C ratio as a function of stellar age. Overall the current model\nincluding thermohaline mixing is able to reproduce very well the C- and\nN-abundances over the whole metallicity range investigated by the GES data.</td>

      <td>The Orphan Stream is one of the most prominent tidal streams in the Galactic\nhalo. Using data on red giants, RR Lyrae, and horizontal branch stars from Gaia\nand other surveys, we determine the proper motion of the Orphan Stream over a\npath of more than 90 degrees on the sky. We also provide updated tracks for the\nsky position, distance, and radial velocity of the stream. Our tracks in these\nlatter dimensions mostly agree with previous results. However, there are\nsignificant corrections to the earlier distance and latitude tracks as the\nstream approaches the Galactic disk. Stream stars selected with\nthree-dimensional kinematics display a very tight red giant sequence.\nConcordantly, we find that applying a proper motion cut removes the most\nmetal-rich stars from earlier spectroscopic samples of stream stars, though a\nsignificant dispersion remains indicating a dwarf galaxy origin. The\ndeceleration of the stream towards its leading end suggests a circular velocity\nof ~200 km/s at a galactocentric radius ~30 kpc, consistent with other\nindependent evidence. However, the track of the stream departs significantly\nfrom an orbit; the spatial track does not point along the same direction as the\nvelocity vector, and it exhibits a lateral wiggle that is unlikely to match any\nreasonable orbit. The low metallicity and small dispersion of the stream in the\nvarious coordinates point to a progenitor with a relatively low dynamical mass\n~$10^8$ Msun.</td>

      <td>We present the physical characterization of FSR 1758, a new large, massive\nobject very recently discovered in the Galactic Bulge. The combination of\noptical data from the 2nd Gaia Data Release (GDR2) and the DECam Plane Survey\n(DECaPS), and near-IR data from the VISTA Variables in the V\'{\i}a L\'actea\nExtended Survey (VVVX) led to a clean sample of likely members. Based on this\nintegrated dataset, position, distance, reddening, size, metallicity, absolute\nmagnitude, and proper motion of this object are measured. We estimate the\nfollowing parameters: $\alpha=17:31:12$, $\delta=-39:48:30$ (J2000), $D=11.5\n\pm 1.0$ kpc, $E(J-Ks)=0.20 \pm 0.03$ mag, $R_c=10$ pc, $R_t=150$ pc,\n$[Fe/H]=-1.5 \pm 0.3$ dex, $M_i < -8.6 \pm 1.0$, $\mu_{\alpha} = -2.85$ mas\nyr$^{-1}$, and $\mu_{\delta} = 2.55$ mas yr$^{-1}$. The nature of this object\nis discussed. If FRS 1758 is a genuine globular cluster, it is one of the\nlargest in the Milky Way, with a size comparable or even larger than that of\n$\omega$ Cen, being also an extreme outlier in the size vs. Galactocentric\ndistance diagram. The presence of a concentration of long-period RR Lyrae\nvariable stars and blue horizontal branch stars suggests that it is a typical\nmetal-poor globular cluster of Oosterhoff type II. Further exploration of a\nlarger surrounding field reveals common proper motion stars, suggesting either\ntidal debris or that FRS\,1758 is actually the central part of a larger\nextended structure such as a new dwarf galaxy, tentatively named as Scorpius.\nIn either case, this object is remarkable, and its discovery graphically\nillustrates the possibility to find other large objects hidden in the Galactic\nBulge using future surveys.</td>

      <td>Flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies are considered as an evidence for\ndark matter, but the rotation curve of the Milky Way is difficult to measure.\nVarious objects were used to track the rotation curve in the outer parts of the\nGalaxy, but most studies rely on incomplete kinematical information and\ninaccurate distances. Here, we use a sample of 773 Classical Cepheids with\nprecise distances based on mid-infrared period-luminosity relations coupled\nwith proper motions and radial velocities from Gaia to construct the accurate\nrotation curve of the Milky Way up to the distance of ~20 kpc from the Galactic\ncenter. We use a simple model of Galactic rotation to measure the rotation\nspeed of the Sun Theta_0 = 233.6 +/- 2.8 km/s, assuming a prior on the distance\nto the Galactic center R_0 = 8.122 +/- 0.031 kpc from the Gravity\nCollaboration. The rotation curve at Galactocentric distances 4 < R < 20 kpc is\nnearly flat with a small gradient of -1.34 +/- 0.21 km/s/kpc. This is the most\naccurate Galactic rotation curve at distances R > 12 kpc constructed so far.</td>

      <td>With the help of Gaia DR2, we are able to obtain the full 6-D phase space\ninformation for stars from LAMOST DR5. With high precision of position,\nvelocity, and metallicity, the rotation of the local stellar halo is presented\nusing the K giant stars with [Fe/H]$<-1$ dex within 4 kpc from the Sun. By\nfitting the rotational velocity distribution with three Gaussian components,\nstellar halo, disk, and a counter-rotating hot population, we find that the\nlocal halo progradely rotates with $V_T=+27^{+4}_{-5}$ km s$^{-1}$ providing\nthe local standard of rest velocity of $V_{LSR}=232$ km s$^{-1}$. Meanwhile, we\nobtain the dispersion of rotational velocity is $\sigma_{T}=72^{+4}_{-4}$ km\ns$^{-1}$. Although the rotational velocity strongly depends on the choice of\n$V_{LSR}$, the trend of prograde rotation is substantial even when $V_{LSR}$ is\nset at as low as 220 km s$^{-1}$. Moreover, we derive the rotation for\nsubsamples with different metallicities and find that the rotational velocity\nis essentially not correlated with [Fe/H]. This may hint a secular evolution\norigin of the prograde rotation. It shows that the metallicity of the\nprogradely rotating halo is peaked within -1.9$<$[Fe/H]$<$-1.6 without\nconsidering the selection effect. We also find a small fraction of\ncounter-rotating stars with larger dispersion and lower metallicity. Finally,\nthe disk component rotates with $V_T=+182^{+6}_{-6}$ km s$^{-1}$ and\n$\sigma_T=45^{+3}_{-3}$ km s$^{-1}$, which is quite consistent with the\nmetal-weak thick disk population.</td>

We derive the\ncircular velocity curve with the Jeans equation assuming an axisymmetric\ngravitational potential. At the location of the Sun we determine the circular\nvelocity with its formal uncertainty to be $v_{\rm c}(R_{\odot}) =\n(229.0\pm0.2)\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$ with systematic uncertainties at the $\sim 2-5\%$\nlevel.

We exclude the inner\n$5$ kpc from our analysis due to the presence of the Galactic bar, which\nstrongly influences the kinematic structure and requires modeling in a\nnon-axisymmetric potential. Combining our results with external measurements of\nthe mass distribution for the baryonic components of the Milky Way from other\nstudies, we estimate the Galaxy's dark halo mass within the virial radius to be\n$M_{\rm vir} = (7.25\pm0.26)\cdot 10^{11}M_{\odot}$ and a local dark matter\ndensity of $\rho_{\rm dm}(R_{\odot}) = 0.30\pm0.03\,\rm GeV\,cm^{-3}$.</td>

      <td>Characterization and history of the Helmi streams with Gaia DR2</td>
      <td>The halo of the Milky Way has long been hypothesized to harbour significant\namounts of merger debris. This view has been supported over more than a decade\nby wide-field photometric surveys which have revealed the outer halo to be\nlumpy. The recent release of Gaia DR2 is allowing us to establish that mergers\nalso have been important and possibly built up the majority of the inner halo.\nIn this work we focus on the Helmi streams, a group of streams crossing the\nSolar vicinity and known for almost two decades. We characterize their\nproperties and relevance for the build-up of the Milky Way's halo. We identify\nnew members of the Helmi streams in an unprecedented dataset with full\nphase-space information combining Gaia DR2, and the APOGEE DR2, RAVE DR5 and\nLAMOST DR4 spectroscopic surveys. Based on the orbital properties of the stars,\nwe find new stream members up to a distance of 5 kpc from the Sun, which we\ncharacterize using photometry and metallicity information. We also perform\nN-body experiments to constrain the time of accretion and properties of the\nprogenitor of the streams. We find nearly 600 new members of the Helmi streams.\nTheir HR diagram reveals a broad age range, from approximately 11 to 13 Gyr,\nwhile their metallicity distribution goes from $\sim$ 2.3 to $\sim$1.0, and\npeaks at [Fe/H] $\sim$1.5. These findings confirm that the streams originate in\na dwarf galaxy. Furthermore, we find 7 globular clusters to be likely\nassociated, and which follow a well-defined age-metallicity sequence whose\nproperties suggest a relatively massive progenitor object. Our N-body\nsimulations favour a system with a stellar mass of $\sim\n10^8\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ accreted $5 - 8$ Gyr ago. The debris from the Helmi\nstreams is an important donor to the MilkyWay halo, contributing approximately\n15\% of its mass in field stars and 10\% of its globular clusters.</td>

In this\nwork, we compare the chemical abundances of dwarf stars in wide binaries to\ntest the abundance consistency of stars of a common origin. Our sample of 31\nwide binaries is identified from a catalog produced by cross-matching APOGEE\nstars with UCAC5 astrometry, and we confirm the fidelity of this sample with\nprecision parallaxes from Gaia DR2. For as many as 14 separate elements, we\ncompare the abundances between components of our wide binaries, finding they\nhave very similar chemistry (typically within 0.1 dex). This level of\nconsistency is more similar than can be expected from stars with different\norigins (which show typical abundance differences of 0.3-0.4 dex within our\nsample). For the best measured elements, Fe, Si, K, Ca, Mn, and Ni, these\ndifferences are reduced to 0.05-0.08 dex when selecting pairs of dwarf stars\nwith similar temperatures. Our results suggest that APOGEE dwarf stars may\ncurrently be used for chemical tagging at the level of $\sim$0.1 dex or at the\nlevel of $\sim$0.05 dex when restricting for the best-measured elements in\nstars of similar temperatures. Larger wide binary catalogs may provide\ncalibration sets, in complement to open cluster samples, for on-going\nspectroscopic surveys.</td>

      <td>As we enter a golden age for studies of internal kinematics and dynamics of\nGalactic globular clusters (GCs), it is timely to assess the performance of\nmodelling techniques in recovering the mass, mass profile, and other dynamical\nproperties of GCs. Here, we compare different mass-modelling techniques\n(distribution-function (DF)-based models, Jeans models, and a grid of N-body\nmodels) by applying them to mock observations from a star-by-star N-body\nsimulation of the GC M 4 by Heggie. The mocks mimic existing and anticipated\ndata for GCs: surface brightness or number density profiles, local stellar mass\nfunctions, line-of-sight velocities, and Hubble Space Telescope- and Gaia-like\nproper motions. We discuss the successes and limitations of the methods. We\nfind that multimass DF-based models, Jeans, and N-body models provide more\naccurate mass profiles compared to single-mass DF-based models. We highlight\ncomplications in fitting the kinematics in the outskirts due to energetically\nunbound stars associated with the cluster ("potential escapers", not captured\nby truncated DF models nor by N-body models of clusters in isolation), which\ncan be avoided with DF-based models including potential escapers, or with Jeans\nmodels. We discuss ways to account for mass segregation. For example,\nthree-component DF-based models with freedom in their mass function are a\nsimple alternative to avoid the biases of single-mass models (which\nsystematically underestimate the total mass, half-mass radius, and central\ndensity), while more realistic multimass DF-based models with freedom in the\nremnant content represent a promising avenue to infer the total mass and the\nmass function of remnants.</td>

We have developed a Bayesian method that generates 2D probability\nmaps of a star's age and metallicity from photometry and parallax using\nisochrones. Our synthetic tests show that including a near-UV passband enables\nus to break the degeneracy between a star's age and metallicity for certain\nevolutionary stages. It is possible to find well-constrained ages and\nmetallicities for turn-off and sub-giant stars with colours including a U band\nand a parallax with uncertainty less than ~20%. Metallicities alone are\npossible for the main sequence and giant branch. We find good agreement with\nthe literature when we apply our method to the Gaia benchmark stars,\nparticularly for turn-off and young stars. Further tests on the old open\ncluster NGC 188, however, reveal significant limitations in the stellar\nisochrones. The ages derived for the cluster stars vary with evolutionary\nstage, such that turn-off ages disagree with those on the sub-giant branch, and\nmetallicities vary significantly throughout. Furthermore, the parameters vary\nappreciably depending on which colour combinations are used in the derivation.\nWe identify the causes of these mismatches and show that improvements are\nneeded in the modelling of giant branch stars and in the creation and\ncalibration of synthetic near-UV photometry. Our results warn against applying\nisochrone fitting indiscriminately. In particular, the uncertainty on the\nstellar models should be quantitatively taken into account. Further efforts to\nimprove the models will result in significant advancements in our ability to\nstudy the Galaxy.</td>

      <td>The RR Lyrae (RRL) rich globular cluster M 62 (NGC 6266) is one of the most\nmassive globular clusters in the Milky Way, located in the dense region of the\nGalactic bulge, where dynamical processes that affect the survival of globular\nclusters are maximised. Using Gaia DR2 data we have found clear evidence for an\nexcess of RRLs beyond the cluster tidal radius of M 62, associated partly with\nstars stripped into the Galaxy field. This is confirmed with new VVVX survey\nobservations, that discard any differential reddening effect as the possible\ncause of the observed RRL density excess. We also determined the orbit of M 62\nusing accurate new measurements of its distance, radial velocity and proper\nmotions (PMs), finding that its orbit is prograde respect to the direction of\nthe Galactic rotation. Orbits are integrated in the non-axisymmetric galactic\nmodel \texttt{GravPot16}, which includes the perturbations due to the central\nGalactic bar. M 62 shows a particular orbital behaviour, having a dynamical\nsignature of the bar-bulge region. The small extra-tidal RRLs extensions\nobserved are roughly aligned towards the galactic center and the direction\nalmost perpendicular to the galactic plane and not with its motion along its\norbit, which may be a clear sign of bulge-crossing shocks, during the last\npassage close of the cluster towards its perigalacticon. M 62 would be the\nfirst clear observed case of bulge shocking in the inner Galaxy acting on a\nglobular cluster.</td>

      <td>Emergence of the Gaia Phase Space Spirals from Bending Waves</td>
      <td>We discuss the physical mechanism by which pure vertical bending waves in a\nstellar disc evolve to form phase space spirals similar to those discovered by\nAntoja et al. ( arXiv:1804.10196) in Gaia Data Release 2. These spirals were\nfound by projecting Solar Neighbourhood stars onto the $z-v_z$ plane. Faint\nspirals appear in the number density of stars projected onto the $z-v_z$ plane,\nwhich can be explained by a simple model for phase wrapping. More prominent\nspirals are seen when bins across the $z-v_z$ plane are coloured by median\n$v_R$ or $v_\phi$. We use both toy model and fully self-consistent simulations\nto show that the spirals develop naturally from vertical bending oscillations\nof a stellar disc. The underlying physics follows from the observation that the\nvertical energy of a star (essentially, its "radius" in the $z-v_z$ plane)\ncorrelates with its angular momentum or, alternatively, guiding radius.\nMoreover, at fixed physical radius, the guiding radius determines the azimuthal\nvelocity. Together, these properties imply the link between in-plane and\nvertical motion that lead directly to the Gaia spirals. We show that the cubic\n$R-z$ coupling term in the effective potential is crucial for understanding the\nmorphology of the spirals. This suggests that phase space spirals might be a\npowerful probe of the Galactic potential. In addition, we argue that\nself-gravity is necessary to properly model the evolution of the bending waves\nand their attendant phase space spirals.</td>

      <td>The vertical structure and dynamics of stars in our local Galactic\nneighbourhood contains much information about the local distribution of visible\nand dark matter and of perturbations to the Milky Way disc. We use data on the\npositions and velocities of stars in the solar neighbourhood from \gaia\ DR2\nand large spectroscopic surveys to investigate the vertical number counts and\nmean-velocity trend as a function of distance from the local Galactic\nmid-plane. We perform a detailed measurement of the wave-like North-South\nasymmetry in the vertical number counts, which reveals a number of deficits at\nheights $\approx 0.4\,\mathrm{kpc}$, $\approx 0.9\,\mathrm{kpc}$, and $\approx\n1.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$, and peaks at $\approx 0.2\,\mathrm{kpc}$, $\approx\n0.7\,\mathrm{kpc}$, and $\approx 1.1\,\mathrm{kpc}$. We find that the asymmetry\npattern is independent of colour. The mean vertical velocity is almost constant\nto $<1\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ within a few 100 pc from the mid-plane and then\ndisplays a North-South symmetric dip at $\approx0.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$ with an\namplitude of $\approx 2\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ that is a plausible velocity\ncounterpart to the main number-count dip at a similar height. Thus, with \gaia\\nDR2 we confirm at high fidelity that the local Galactic disc is undergoing a\nwave-like oscillation and a dynamically-consistent observational picture of the\nperturbed local vertical structure emerges for the first time. We also present\nthe most precise and accurate determination of the Sun's height above the local\nGalactic mid-plane, correcting for any asymmetry in the vertical density:\n$z_\odot = 20.8 \pm 0.3\,\mathrm{pc}$.</td>

Combining the velocity dispersion profiles derived\nhere with new measurements of the internal mass functions allows us to model\nthe internal kinematics of 144 clusters, more than 90% of the currently known\nGalactic globular cluster population. We also derive the initial cluster masses\nby calculating the cluster orbits backwards in time applying suitable recipes\nto account for mass loss and dynamical friction. We find a correlation between\nthe stellar mass function of a globular cluster and the amount of mass lost\nfrom the cluster, pointing to dynamical evolution as one of the mechanisms\nshaping the mass function of stars in clusters. The mass functions also show\nstrong evidence that globular clusters started with a bottom-light initial mass\nfunction. Our simulations show that the currently surviving globular cluster\npopulation has lost about 80% of its mass since the time of formation. If\nglobular clusters started from a log-normal mass function, we estimate that the\nMilky Way contained about 500 globular clusters initially, with a combined mass\nof about $2.5 \cdot 10^8$ $M_\odot$. For a power-law initial mass function, the\ninitial mass in globular clusters could have been a factor of three higher.</td>

We have performed\nradial velocity monitoring of a sample of 22 CEMP-no stars to further study the\nrole binarity plays in this type of CEMP star. We find four new binary CEMP-no\nstars based on their radial velocity variations, thereby significantly\nenlarging the population of known binaries to a total of eleven. One of the new\nbinary systems is HE 0107-5240, one of the most iron-poor stars known,\nsupporting the binary transfer model for the origin of the abundance pattern of\nthis star. In our sample we find a difference in binary fraction depending on\nthe absolute carbon abundance, with a binary fraction of $47^{\,+15\,}_{\,-14}\n\%$ for stars with higher absolute carbon abundance and $18^{\,+14\,}_{\,\,-9}\n\%$ for stars with lower absolute carbon abundance. This potentially implies a\nrelation between a high carbon abundance and the binarity of a metal-poor star.\nAlthough binarity does not equate to mass transfer, there is a possibility that\na CEMP-no star in a binary system has been polluted and care has to be taken in\nthe interpretation of their abundance patterns. We furthermore demonstrate the\npotential of Gaia to discover additional binary candidates.</td>

In addition to\nrotation, internal age variation is indicated as a possible responsible for the\neMSTOs, making these systems the possible young counterparts of globular\nclusters with multiple populations. Recent work has shown that the\neMSTO+broadened MSs are not a peculiarity of MCs clusters.

The Gaia Collaboration has used Gaia-DR2 sources with\nsix-dimensional (6D) phase space information to derive kinematical maps within\n5 kpc of the Sun, which is a reachable range for stars with relative error in\ndistance lower than 20%.\n  AIMS. Here we aim to extend the range of distances by a factor of two to\nthree, thus adding the range of Galactocentric distances between 13 kpc and 20\nkpc to the previous maps, with their corresponding error and root mean square\nvalues.\n  METHODS. We make use of the whole sample of stars of Gaia-DR2 including\nradial velocity measurements, which consists in more than seven million\nsources, and we apply a statistical deconvolution of the parallax errors based\non the Lucy's inversion method of the Fredholm integral equations of the first\nkind, without assuming any prior.\n  RESULTS. The new extended maps provide lots of new and corroborated\ninformation about the disk kinematics: significant departures of circularity in\nthe mean orbits with radial Galactocentric velocities between -20 and +20 km/s\nand vertical velocities between -10 and +10 km/s; variations of the azimuthal\nvelocity with position; asymmetries between the northern and the southern\nGalactic hemispheres, especially towards the anticenter that includes a larger\nazimuthal velocity in the south; and others.\n  CONCLUSIONS. These extended kinematical maps can be used to investigate the\ndifferent dynamical models of our Galaxy, and we will present our own analyses\nin the forthcoming second part of this paper. At present, it is evident that\nthe Milky Way is far from a simple stationary configuration in rotational\nequilibrium, but is characterized by streaming motions in all velocity\ncomponents with conspicuous velocity gradients.</td>

We confirm that result from an analysis of\nAPOGEE-DR14 element abundances and $\textit{Gaia}$-DR2 kinematics of halo\nstars. We show that $\sim$2/3 of nearby halo stars have high orbital\neccentricities ($e \gtrsim 0.8$), and abundance patterns typical of massive\nMilky Way dwarf galaxy satellites today, characterised by relatively low\n[Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ni/Fe]. The trend followed by high $e$ stars in\nthe [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane shows a change of slope at [Fe/H]$\sim-1.3$, which is\nalso typical of stellar populations from relatively massive dwarf galaxies. Low\n$e$ stars exhibit no such change of slope within the observed [Fe/H] range and\nshow slightly higher abundances of Mg, Al and Ni. Unlike their low $e$\ncounterparts, high $e$ stars show slightly retrograde motion, make higher\nvertical excursions and reach larger apocentre radii. By comparing the position\nin [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] space of high $e$ stars with those of accreted galaxies from\nthe EAGLE suite of cosmological simulations we constrain the mass of the\naccreted satellite to be in the range $10^{8.5}\lesssim M_*\lesssim\n10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$. We show that the median orbital eccentricities of\ndebris are largely unchanged since merger time, implying that this accretion\nevent likely happened at $z\lesssim1.5$. The exact nature of the low $e$\npopulation is unclear, but we hypothesise that it is a combination of\n$\textit{in situ}$ star formation, high $|z|$ disc stars, lower mass accretion\nevents, and contamination by the low $e$ tail of the high $e$ population.\nFinally, our results imply that the accretion history of the Milky Way was\nquite unusual.</td>

      <td>The Gaia era opens new possibilities for discovering the remnants of\ndisrupted satellite galaxies in the Solar neighborhood. If the population of\nlocal accreted stars is correlated with the dark matter sourced by the same\nmergers, one can then map the dark matter distribution directly. Using two\ncosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies from\nthe Latte suite of Fire-2 simulations, we find a strong correlation between the\nvelocity distribution of stars and dark matter at the solar circle that were\naccreted from luminous satellites. This correspondence holds for dark matter\nthat is either relaxed or in kinematic substructure called debris flow, and is\nconsistent between two simulated hosts with different merger histories. The\ncorrespondence is more problematic for streams because of possible spatial\noffsets between the dark matter and stars. We demonstrate how to reconstruct\nthe dark matter velocity distribution from the observed properties of the\naccreted stellar population by properly accounting for the ratio of stars to\ndark matter contributed by individual mergers. After demonstrating this method\nusing the Fire-2 simulations, we apply it to the Milky Way and use it to\nrecover the dark matter velocity distribution associated with the recently\ndiscovered stellar debris field in the Solar neighborhood. Based on results\nfrom Gaia, we estimate that $42 ^{+26}_{-22}\%$ of the local dark matter that\nis accreted from luminous mergers is in debris flow.</td>

      <td>Gaia Data Release 2: Specific characterisation and validation of all-sky Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars</td>
      <td>The Gaia second Data Release (DR2) presents a first mapping of full-sky RR\nLyrae stars and Cepheids observed by the spacecraft during the initial 22\nmonths of science operations. The Specific Object Study (SOS) pipeline,\ndeveloped to validate and fully characterise Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars (SOS\nCep&RRL) observed by Gaia, has been presented in the documentation and papers\naccompanying the Gaia first Data Release. Here we describe how the SOS pipeline\nwas modified to allow for processing the Gaia multiband (G, G_BP and G_RP) time\nseries photometry of all-sky candidate variables and produce specific results\nfor confirmed RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids that are published in the DR2\ncatalogue. The SOS Cep&RRL processing uses tools such as the period-amplitude\nand the period-luminosity relations in the G band. For the analysis of the Gaia\nDR2 candidates we also used tools based on the G_BP and G_RP photometry, such\nas the period-Wesenheit relation in (G,G_RP). Multiband time series photometry\nand characterisation by the SOS Cep&RRL pipeline are published in Gaia DR2 for\n150,359 such variables (9,575 classified as Cepheids and 140,784 as RR Lyrae\nstars) distributed all over the sky. The sample includes variables in 87\nglobular clusters and 14 dwarf galaxies. To the best of our knowledge, as of 25\nApril 2018, variability of 50,570 of these sources (350 Cepheids and 50,220 RR\nLyrae stars) is not known in the literature, hence likely they are new\ndiscoveries by Gaia. An estimate of the interstellar absorption is published\nfor 54,272 fundamental-mode RR Lyrae stars from a relation based on the G-band\namplitude and the pulsation period. Metallicities derived from the Fourier\nparameters of the light curves are also released for 64,932 RR Lyrae stars and\n3,738 fundamental-mode classical Cepheids with period shorter than 6.3 days.</td>

      <td>MADE: A spectroscopic Mass, Age, and Distance Estimator for red giant stars with Bayesian machine learning</td>
      <td>We present a new approach (MADE) that generates mass, age, and distance\nestimates of red giant stars from a combination of astrometric, photometric,\nand spectroscopic data. The core of the approach is a Bayesian artificial\nneural network (ANN) that learns from and completely replaces stellar\nisochrones. The ANN is trained using a sample of red giant stars with mass\nestimates from asteroseismology. A Bayesian isochrone pipeline uses the\nastrometric, photometric, spectroscopic, and asteroseismology data to determine\nposterior distributions for the training outputs: mass, age, and distance.\nGiven new inputs, posterior predictive distributions for the outputs are\ncomputed, taking into account both input uncertainties, and uncertainties in\nthe ANN parameters.\n  We apply MADE to $\sim10\,000$ red giants in the overlap between the\n14$^{\mathrm{th}}$ data release from the APO Galactic Evolution Experiment\n(APOGEE, Abolfathi et al. 2018) and the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS,\nMichalik et al. 2015). The ANN is able to reduce the uncertainty on mass, age,\nand distance estimates for training-set stars with high output uncertainties\nallocated through the Bayesian isochrone pipeline. The fractional uncertainties\non mass are $<10\%$ and on age are between $10$ to $25\%$. Moreover, the time\ntaken for our ANN to predict masses, ages, and distances for the entire\ncatalogue of APOGEE-TGAS stars is of a similar order of the time taken by the\nBayesian isochrone pipeline to run on a handful of stars. Our resulting\ncatalogue clearly demonstrates the expected thick and thin disc components in\nthe [M/H]-[$\alpha$/M] plane, when examined by age.</td>

      <td>Spectrophotometric parallaxes with linear models: Accurate distances for luminous red-giant stars</td>
      <td>With contemporary infrared spectroscopic surveys like APOGEE, red-giant stars\ncan be observed to distances and extinctions at which Gaia parallaxes are not\nhighly informative. Yet the combination of effective temperature, surface\ngravity, composition, and age - all accessible through spectroscopy -\ndetermines a giant's luminosity. Therefore spectroscopy plus photometry should\nenable precise spectrophotometric distance estimates. Here we use the\nAPOGEE-Gaia-2MASS-WISE overlap to train a data-driven model to predict\nparallaxes for red-giant branch stars with $0<\log g\leq2.2$ (more luminous\nthan the red clump). We employ (the exponentiation of) a linear function of\nAPOGEE spectral pixel intensities and multi-band photometry to predict parallax\nspectrophotometrically. The model training involves no logarithms or inverses\nof the Gaia parallaxes, and needs no cut on the Gaia parallax signal-to-noise\nratio. It includes an L1 regularization to zero out the contributions of\nuninformative pixels. The training is performed with leave-out subsamples such\nthat no star's astrometry is used even indirectly in its spectrophotometric\nparallax estimate. The model implicitly performs a reddening and extinction\ncorrection in its parallax prediction, without any explicit dust model. We\nassign to each star in the sample a new spectrophotometric parallax estimate;\nthese parallaxes have uncertainties of a few to 15 percent, depending on data\nquality, which is more precise than the Gaia parallax for the vast majority of\ntargets, and certainly any stars more than a few kpc distance. We obtain\n10-percent distance estimates out to heliocentric distances of $20\,$kpc, and\nmake global maps of the Milky Way's disk.</td>

      <td>We report here on a detailed study of a c-type RR Lyrae variable (RRc\nvariable), SB 796, serendipitously discovered in a search of the WASP public\ndata for stars that display large photometric periodic modulation. SB 796\ndisplays a period of $P = 0.26585$ d and semi-amplitude of $\sim$ 0.1 mag.\nComparison of the modulation shape and period with the detailed analysis of LMC\nvariables indicates that SB 796 is an RRc variable. Gaia DR2 classification\ncorroborated our result. Radial-velocity (RV) follow-up observations revealed a\nperiodic variation consistent with a sine modulation, with a semi-amplitude of\n$5.6\pm0.2$ km/s, and a minimum at phase of maximum brightness. Similar\namplitude and phase were previously seen in other RRc variables. The stellar\naveraged RV is $\sim 250$ km/s, turning SB 796 to be a high-velocity star,\nwhile its present position, as derived from the Gaia astrometry, is at $\sim\n3.5$ kpc below the Galactic plane. Integration of the stellar Galactic motion\nshows that SB 796 oscillates at a range of 0.5--20 kpc Galacto-centric\ndistance, passing near the Galactic center about three times in 1 Gyr. The\nGalactic radial motion takes SB 796 up and down the plane to a scale height of\n$\sim 10$ kpc. During its $\sim10$ Gyrs estimated life time, SB 796 therefore\npassed $\sim 30$ times near the Galactic center.</td>

      <td>This paper presents the detailed abundances and r-process classifications of\n126 newly identified metal-poor stars as part of an ongoing collaboration, the\nR-Process Alliance. The stars were identified as metal-poor candidates from the\nRAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) and were followed-up at high spectral\nresolution (R~31,500) with the 3.5~m telescope at Apache Point Observatory. The\natmospheric parameters were determined spectroscopically from Fe I lines,\ntaking into account <3D> non-LTE corrections and using differential abundances\nwith respect to a set of standards. Of the 126 new stars, 124 have [Fe/H]<-1.5,\n105 have [Fe/H]<-2.0, and 4 have [Fe/H]<-3.0. Nine new carbon-enhanced\nmetal-poor stars have been discovered, 3 of which are enhanced in r-process\nelements. Abundances of neutron-capture elements reveal 60 new r-I stars (with\n+0.3<=[Eu/Fe]<=+1.0 and [Ba/Eu]<0) and 4 new r-II stars (with [Eu/Fe]>+1.0).\nNineteen stars are found to exhibit a `limited-r' signature ([Sr/Ba]>+0.5,\n[Ba/Eu]<0). For the r-II stars, the second- and third-peak main r-process\npatterns are consistent with the r-process signature in other metal-poor stars\nand the Sun. The abundances of the light, alpha, and Fe-peak elements match\nthose of typical Milky Way halo stars, except for one r-I star which has high\nNa and low Mg, characteristic of globular cluster stars. Parallaxes and proper\nmotions from the second Gaia data release yield UVW space velocities for these\nstars which are consistent with membership in the Milky Way halo. Intriguingly,\nall r-II and the majority of r-I stars have retrograde orbits, which may\nindicate an accretion origin.</td>

For four of these\ndwarfs our proper motion estimate is the first ever provided. The adopted\nastrometric data come from the second data release of the Gaia mission. We\ndetermine the mean proper motion for each galaxy starting from an initial guess\nof likely members, based either on radial velocity measurements or using stars\non the Horizontal Branch identified in the Gaia ($G_{\rm BP}$-$G_{\rm RP}$,$G$)\ncolour-magnitude diagram in the field of view towards the UFD. We then refine\ntheir membership iteratively using both astrometry and photometry. We take into\naccount the full covariance matrix among the astrometric parameters when\nderiving the mean proper motions for these systems. Our procedure provides mean\nproper motions with typical uncertainties of $\sim0.1$ mas/yr, even for\ngalaxies without prior spectroscopic information. In the case of Segue 2 we\nfind that using radial velocity members only leads to biased results,\npresumably because of the small number of stars with measured radial\nvelocities. Our procedure allows to maximize the number of member stars per\ngalaxy regardless of the existence of prior spectroscopic information, and can\ntherefore be applied on any faint or distant stellar system within reach of\nGaia.</td>

We conduct a reanalysis of\nthe star's physical and kinematic properties, which indicates that the star may\nbe an even more extraordinary find than previously reported. The star is a 180\nMyr old 3-4 Mo G5-8 bright giant, with an effective temperature of 4800+/-100\nK, a metallicity of {Fe/H]=-0.5, and a luminosity of log L/Lo=2.70+/-0.20 dex.\nA comparison with evolutionary tracks identifies the star as being in a giant\nor early asymptotic giant branch stage. The proper motion, combined with the\npreviously known radial velocity, yields a total Galactocentric space velocity\nof 296 km/s. The star is currently located 6.4 kpc below the plane of the Milky\nWay, but our analysis of its orbit shows it passed through the disk ~25 Myr\nago. The star's metallicity and age argue against it being native to the halo,\nand we suggest that the star was likely ejected from the disk. We discuss\nseveral ejection mechanisms, and conclude that the most likely scenario is\nejection by the Milky Way's central black hole based upon our analysis of the\nstar's orbit. The identification of the large radial velocity of\nJ01020100-7122208 came about as a happenstance of it being seen in projection\nwith the SMC, and we suggest that many similar objects may be revealed in Gaia\ndata.</td>

The UV and UV$-$optical Colour-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs) are\nconstructed by combining the UVIT, HST-ACS and ground data and compared with\nthe BaSTI isochrones generated for UVIT filters. We used stellar proper motions\ndata from GAIA DR2 to select the cluster members. Our estimations of the\ntemperature distribution of 110 BHB stars reveal two peaks with the main peak\nat $T_{eff}\sim$ 10,300 K with the distribution extending up to $T_{eff}\sim$\n18,000 K. We identify the well known photometric gaps including the G-jump in\nthe BHB distribution which are located between the peaks. We detect a plateau\nin the FUV magnitude for stars hotter than $T_{eff}\sim$ 11,500 K (G-jump),\nwhich could be due to the effect of atomic diffusion. We detect 2 Extreme HB\n(EHB) candidates with temperatures ranging from 29,000 to 32,000 K. The radial\ndistribution of 68 BSSs suggests that the bright BSSs are more centrally\nconcentrated than the faint BSS and the BHB distribution. We find that the BSSs\nhave a mass range of 0.86 - 1.25 M$_{\odot}$ and an age range of 2 - 10 Gyr\nwith a peak at 1 M$_{\odot}$ and 4 Gyr respectively.

Unlike\npreviously discovered blue hypervelocity stars, our sample is metal-poor (-1.5\n$<$ [Fe/H] $<$ -1.0) and quite old ($>$ 1 Gyr). We discuss possible mechanisms\nfor accelerating old stars to such extreme velocities. The high observed space\ndensity of this population, relative to potential acceleration mechanisms,\nimplies that these stars are probably bound to the Milky Way (MW). If they are\nbound, the discovery of this population would require a local escape speed of\naround $\sim$ 600 km/s and consequently imply a virial mass of $M_{200} \sim\n1.4 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$ for the MW.</td>

Then the obtained mock populations are reddened with a 3D dust map and\nare subjected to the selection criteria corresponding to the RAVE and TGAS\nobservational limitations as well as to additional cuts applied to the data\nsample. We calculate the quantities of interest separately at different heights\nabove the Galactic plane taking into account the distance error effects\nseparately in horizontal and vertical directions. We investigate the simulated\nsample in terms of the vertical number density profiles, Hess diagrams and\nvelocity distribution functions. Basing on a good agreement of our simulations\nwith the data, we conclude that our fiducial disc model confidently reproduces\nthe vertical trends in the thin disc stellar population properties.

Furthermore, we provide posterior extinction estimates ($A_V$)\nto every star using published extinction maps as a prior input. We provide an\nappendix with extinction coefficients for Gaia photometry derived from stellar\nmodels, which account for variation with intrinsic colour and total extinction.\nOur pipeline provides output estimates of the spectroscopic parameters, which\ncan be used to inform improved spectroscopic analysis. We complement our\ncatalogues with Galactocentric coordinates and actions with associated\nuncertainties. As a demonstration of the power of our catalogue, we produce\nvelocity dispersion profiles of the disc separated by age and Galactocentric\nradius (between $3$ and $15\,\mathrm{kpc}$ from the Galactic centre). This\nsuggests that the velocity dispersion profiles flatten with radius in the outer\nGalaxy ($>8\,\mathrm{kpc}$) and that at all radii the velocity dispersion\nfollows the smooth power law with age observed in the solar neighbourhood.</td>

      <td>Constraining the Solar Galactic Reflex Velocity Using Gaia Observations of the Sagittarius Stream</td>
      <td>Because of its particular orientation around the Galaxy - i.e., in a plane\nnearly perpendicular to the Galactic plane and containing both the Sun and\nGalactic center - the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream provides a powerful means by\nwhich to measure the solar reflex velocity, and thereby infer the velocity of\nthe Local Standard of Rest (LSR), in a way that is independent of assumptions\nabout the solar Galactocentric distance. Moreover, the solar reflex velocity\nwith respect to the stream is projected almost entirely into the proper motion\ncomponent of Sgr stream stars perpendicular to the Sgr plane, which makes the\ninferred velocity relatively immune to most Sgr model assumptions. Using Gaia\nDR2 proper motions of ~2,000 stars identified to be Sgr stream candidates in\nconcert with the Law and Majewski (2010) Sgr N-body models (which provide a\ngood match to the Gaia observations) we constrain the solar reflex velocity\ninduced by its orbital motion around the Galaxy to be $\Theta_{\odot} = 253 \pm\n6$ km/s. Assuming a solar peculiar motion in the direction of orbital rotation\nof 12 km/s, and an LSR velocity of 12 km/s with respect to the local circular\nspeed, the implied circular speed of the Milky Way at the solar circle is $229\n\pm 6$ km/s.</td>

      <td>We search for the fastest stars in the subset of stars with radial velocity\nmeasurements of the second data release (DR2) of the European Space Agency\nmission Gaia. Starting from the observed positions, parallaxes, proper motions,\nand radial velocities, we construct the distance and total velocity\ndistribution of more than $7$ million stars in our Milky Way, deriving the full\n6D phase space information in Galactocentric coordinates. These information are\nshared in a catalogue, publicly available at\nhttp://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~marchetti/research.html. To search for unbound\nstars, we then focus on stars with a probability greater than $50 \%$ of being\nunbound from the Milky Way. This cut results in a clean sample of $125$ sources\nwith reliable astrometric parameters and radial velocities. Of these, $20$\nstars have probabilities greater than 80 $\%$ of being unbound from the Galaxy.\nOn this latter sub-sample, we perform orbit integration to characterize the\nstars' orbital parameter distributions. As expected given the relatively small\nsample size of bright stars, we find no hypervelocity star candidates, stars\nthat are moving on orbits consistent with coming from the Galactic Centre.\nInstead, we find $7$ hyper-runaway star candidates, coming from the Galactic\ndisk. Surprisingly, the remaining $13$ unbound stars cannot be traced back to\nthe Galaxy, including two of the fastest stars (around $700$ km/s). If\nconformed, these may constitute the tip of the iceberg of a large extragalactic\npopulation or the extreme velocity tail of stellar streams.</td>

We want to take advantage of the F/1O\ndouble-mode Cepheids listed in the Gaia DR2 catalogue to derive the metallicity\ngradient in the Milky Way disk. The metallicity is derived from the ratio of\nthe first overtone and fundamental periods provided by Gaia DR2 while the Gaia\nDR2 parallaxes are used to determine the Galactocentric distances of the stars.\nFrom a visual inspection of the light curves, it turns out that a large\nfraction (77%) of the Galactic F/1O double-mode Cepheids in Gaia DR2 are\nspurious detections. Gaia DR2 provides 3 new bona fide F/1O Cepheids. Combining\nthem with the currently known F/1O Cepheids and using the Gaia DR2 parallaxes\nfor the entire sample, we can derive the metallicity gradient in the Milky Way\ndisk. We find a slope of -0.045$\pm$0.007 dex/kpc using a bootstrap method, and\nof -0.040$\pm$0.002 dex/kpc using a total least squares method. These results\nare in good agreement with previous determinations of the [Fe/H] gradient in\nthe disk based on canonical Cepheids. The period ratio of F/1O Cepheids allows\nfor a reliable determination of the metallicity gradient in the Milky Way, and\nin turn, in other systems that would be difficult to reach via classical\nspectroscopic methods.</td>

      <td>A method to calculate gravitational accelerations within discrete localised regions in the Milky Way</td>
      <td>We present a method to calculate gravitational potential gradients within\nregions containing few tens of thousands stars with known phase space\ncoordinates. The central idea of the method is to calculate orbital arcs for\neach star within a given region for a certain parametrised potential\n(gravitational acceleration) and to assume that position of each star on its\norbital arc is a random variable with a uniform probability density in time.\nThereafter, by combining individual probability densities of stars it is\npossible to calculate the overall probability density distribution and\nlikelihood for a given region as a function of gravitational acceleration\nparameters. The likelihood has a maximum if the calculated probability\ndistribution and the observed distribution of stars in phase space are\nconsistent. This allows us to constrain gravitational accelerations and\npotential gradient values. The method assumes that phases of stars are mixed\nwithin the regions where stellar orbits are calculated. We tested the method\nfor 12 small rectangular regions within simulated disc galaxy from Gaia Wiki.\nTests show that even with a rather simple acceleration form the calculated\naccelerations in galactic plane coincide with their true values from simulation\nabout 5 per cent, misalignment between the calculated and true acceleration\nvector directions is less than 1 degree (median values). The model can be used\nwith the Milky Way Gaia complete solution data.</td>

      <td>Westerlund 2 (Wd2) is the central ionizing star cluster of the \ion{H}{2}\nregion RCW~49 and the second most massive young star cluster (${\rm M} = (3.6\n\pm 0.3)\times 10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$) in the Milky Way. Its young age\n($\sim2\,$Myr) and close proximity to the Sun ($\sim 4\,$kpc) makes it a\nperfect target to study stars emerging from their parental gas cloud, the large\nnumber of OB-stars and their feedback onto the gas, and the gas dynamics. We\ncombine high-resolution multi-band photometry obtained in the optical and\nnear-infrared with the \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope (HST), and VLT/MUSE\nintegral field spectroscopy to study the gas, the stars, and their\ninteractions, simultaneously. In this paper we focus on a small,\n$64\times64\,{\rm arcsec}^2$ region North of the main cluster center, which we\ncall the Northern Bubble (NB), a circular cavity carved into the gas of the\ncluster region. Using MUSE data, we determined the spectral types of 17 stars\nin the NB from G9III to O7.5. With the estimation of these spectral types we\nadd 2 O and 5 B-type stars to the previously published census of 37 OB-stars in\nWd2. To measure radial velocities we extracted 72 stellar spectra throughout\nWd2, including the 17 of the NB, and show that the cluster member stars follow\na bimodal velocity distribution centered around $(8.10 \pm 1.53)\,{\rm\nkm}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $(25.41 \pm 1.57)\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ with a\ndispersion of $(4.52 \pm 1.78)\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $(3.46 \pm\n1.29)\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$, respectively. These are in agreement with\nCO($J=1$-2) studies of RCW~49 leaving cloud-cloud collision as a viable option\nfor the formation scenario of Wd2.

      <td>Radial velocities of 1726 candidate B- and A-type stars within 3deg of the\nGalactic center (GC) were estimated from FLAMES/VLT spectra in the range of\n396-457 nm. The final sample was limited to 1507 stars with either Gaia DR2\nparallaxes or main-sequence B-type stars having reliable spectroscopic\ndistances. The solar peculiar motion in the direction of the GC relative to the\nlocal standard of rest (LSR) was estimated to Uo = 10.7+-1.3 km/s. The\nvariation in the median radial velocity relative to the LSR as a function of\ndistance from the sun shows a gradual increase from slightly negative values\nnear the sun to almost 5 km/s at a distance of around 4 kpc. A sinusoidal\nfunction with an amplitude of 3.4+-1.3 km/s and a maximum at 4.0+-0.6 kpc\ninside the sun is the best fit to the data. A positive median radial velocity\nrelative to the LSR around 1.8 kpc, the expected distance to the Sagittarius\narm, can be excluded at a 99% level of confidence. A marginal peak detected at\nthis distance may be associated with stellar streams in the star-forming\nregions, but it is too narrow to be associated with a major arm feature. A\ncomparison with test-particle simulations in a fixed galactic potential with an\nimposed spiral pattern shows the best agreement with a two-armed spiral\npotential having the Scutum-Crux arm as the next major inner arm. A relative\nradial forcing of ~1.5% and a pattern speed in the range of 20-30 km/s/kpc\nyield the best fit. The lack of a positive velocity perturbation in the region\naround the Sagittarius arm excludes it from being a major arm. Thus, the main\nspiral potential of the Galaxy is two-armed, while the Sagittarius arm is an\ninter-arm feature with only a small mass perturbation associated with it.</td>

Comparison of the distributions of orbital\napocenters and 3D velocities to the halo virial radius and escape velocity,\nrespectively, suggests that the satellite kinematics are best explained in the\nhigh-mass halo. Tuc III, Crater II, and additional candidates have orbital\npericenters small enough to imply significant tidal influences. Relevant to the\nmissing satellite problem, the fact that fewer galaxies are observed to be near\napocenter than near pericenter implies that there must be a population of\ndistant dwarf galaxies yet to be discovered. Of the 39 dwarfs: 12 have orbital\npoles that do not align with the MW plane of satellites (given reasonable\nassumptions about its intrinsic thickness); 10 have insufficient PM accuracy to\nestablish whether they align; and 17 satellites align, of which 11 are\nco-orbiting and (somewhat surprisingly, in view of prior knowledge) 6 are\ncounter-orbiting. Group infall might have contributed to this, but no\ndefinitive association is found for the members of the Crater-Leo group.</td>

We calculate six-dimensional\npositions and velocities, evaluate energies and integrals of motion, and\ncompute orbits for each of these stars using parallaxes and proper motions from\nthe second Gaia data release and published radial velocities. All of these\nstars have halo kinematics. Most stars (66%) remain in the inner regions of the\nhalo (< 13 kpc), and many (51%) have orbits that pass within 2.6 kpc of the\nGalactic center. Several stars (20%) have orbits that extend beyond 20 kpc,\nincluding one with an orbital apocenter larger than the Milky Way virial\nradius. We apply three clustering methods to search for structure in phase\nspace, and we identify eight groups. No abundances are considered in the\nclustering process, but the [Fe/H] dispersions of the groups are smaller than\nwould be expected by random chance. The orbital properties, clustering in phase\nspace and metallicity, and lack of highly r-process-enhanced stars on disk-like\norbits indicate that such stars likely were accreted from disrupted satellites.\nComparison with the galaxy luminosity-metallicity relation suggests M_V > -9\nfor most of the progenitor satellites, characteristic of ultra-faint or\nlow-luminosity classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Environments with low rates\nof star formation and Fe production, rather than the nature of the r-process\nsite, may be key to obtaining the [Eu/Fe] ratios found in highly\nr-process-enhanced stars.</td>

These discoveries are only\npossible because of the exquisite astrometry from Gaia, which permits a clean\nseparation of the stream from Milky Way stars. The additional length and a\nproper treatment of the progenitor will aid in dynamical modeling of GD-1 for\nmapping the large-scale dark matter distribution.

We propose that the\nstructures on the $U-V$ planes, known as the moving groups, can be mainly\nexplained by the spiral arms perturbations. The applied model of the Galactic\ndisk and spiral arms, with the parameters defined by observational data and\nwith pattern speed $\Omega_p=$28.0 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, is the same that\nallowed us to explain the origin of the Local Arm and the Sun's orbit trapped\ninside the corotation resonance (CR). We show that the $U-V$ picture of the SN\nconsists of the main component, associated with the CR, and the inner and outer\nstructures, which we could associate with the Hercules and Sirius streams,\nrespectively. The Coma-Berenices and Hyades-Pleiades groups and the Sun itself\nbelong to the main part. The substructures of Hercules are formed mainly by the\nnearby 8/1, 12/1, and even 6/1 inner Lindblad resonances, while Sirius is\nshaped by the bulk of overlapping outer Lindblad resonances, -8/1, -12/1,\n-16/1, which are stuck to the CR. This richness in resonances only exists near\ncorotation, which should be of the spiral arms, not of the Galactic bar, whose\nstable corotation zone is far away from the Sun. The model's predictions of the\nvelocity distribution match qualitatively and quantitatively the distribution\nprovided by Gaia DR2.</td>

The dark matter halo consists of a\nsmooth component and a population of subhaloes while the disc is composed of\nthin and thick components. Also considered is a control simulation where all of\nthe halo mass is smoothly distributed. We find that bending waves are more\nvigorously excited in the thin disc than the thick one and that they are\nstrongest in the outer regions of the disc, especially at late times. By way of\na Fourier decomposition, we find that the complicated pattern of bending across\nthe disc can be described as a superposition of waves, which concentrate along\ntwo branches in the radius-rotational frequency plane. These branches\ncorrespond to vertical resonance curves as predicted by a WKB analysis. Bending\nwaves in the simulation with substructure have a higher amplitude than those in\nthe smooth-halo simulation, though the frequency-radius characteristics of the\nwaves in the two simulations are very similar. A cross correlation analysis of\nvertical displacement and bulk vertical velocity suggests that the waves\noscillate largely as simple plane waves. We suggest that the wave-like features\nin astrometric surveys such as the Second Data Release from \textit{Gaia} may\nbe due to long-lived waves of a dynamically active disc rather than, or in\naddition to, perturbations from a recent satellite-disc encounter.</td>

      <td>We make a first attempt to find dwarf galaxies in eight \Fermi-LAT extended,\nunassociated, source fields using \Gaia\ DR2. We probe previously unexplored\nheliocentric distances of $d<20$~kpc with an extreme-deconvolution (XD)\ntechnique. We find no signature of a dwarf galaxy in any of these fields\ndespite \Gaia's excellent astrometric accuracy. We estimate our detection\nlimits by applying the XD method to mock data, obtaining a conservative limit\non the stellar mass of $M_* < 10^4$~M$_{\sun}$ for $d < 20$\, kpc. Such a low\nstellar mass implies either a low-mass subhalo, or a massive stripped-down\nsubhalo. We use an analytic model for stripped subhalos to argue that, given\nthe sizes and fluxes of the \Fermi-LAT sources, we can reject the hypothesis\nthat they owe to dark matter annihilation.</td>

      <td>An unsettled question concerning the formation and distribution of massive\nstars is whether they must be born in massive clusters and, if found in less\ndense environments, whether they must have migrated there. With the advent of\nwide-area digital photometric surveys, it is now possible to identify massive\nstars away from prominent Galactic clusters without bias. In this study we\nconsider 40 candidate OB stars found in the field around the young massive\ncluster, Westerlund 2, by Mohr-Smith et al (2017): these are located inside a\nbox of 1.5x1.5 square degrees and are selected on the basis of their\nextinctions and K magnitudes. We present VLT/X-shooter spectra of two of the\nhottest O stars, respectively 11 and 22 arcmin from the centre of Westerlund 2.\nThey are confirmed as O4V stars, with stellar masses likely to be in excess of\n40 Msun. Their radial velocities relative to the non-binary reference object,\nMSP 182, in Westerlund 2 are -29.4 +/- 1.7 and -14.4 +/- 2.2 km/s,\nrespectively. Using Gaia DR2 proper motions we find that between 8 and 11 early\nO/WR stars in the studied region (including the two VLT targets, plus WR 20c\nand WR 20aa) could have been ejected from Westerlund 2 in the last one million\nyears. This represents an efficiency of massive-star ejection of up to 25%. On\nsky, the positions of these stars and their proper motions show a near N--S\nalignment. We discuss the possibility that these results are a consequence of\nprior sub-cluster merging combining with dynamical ejection.</td>

In this study we\naim to a establish list of members and derive mean parameters, in particular\ndistances, for as many clusters as possible, making use of Gaia data alone.

We obtained a list of\nmembers and cluster parameters for 1229 clusters. As expected, the youngest\nclusters are seen to be tightly distributed near the Galactic plane and to\ntrace the spiral arms of the Milky Way, while older objects are more uniformly\ndistributed, deviate further from the plane, and tend to be located at larger\nGalactocentric distances. Thanks to the quality of GaiaDR2 astrometry, the\nfully homogeneous parameters derived in this study are the most precise to\ndate. Furthermore, we report on the serendipitous discovery of 60 new open\nclusters in the fields analysed during this study.</td>

      <td>The series of events, which occurred at high redshift and originated multiple\nstellar populations in Globular Clusters (GCs) are still poorly understood.\nTheoretical work suggests that the present-day dynamics of stars in nearby GCs,\nincluding the rotation and velocity dispersion, may retain important clues on\nthe formation of multiple populations. So far, the dynamics of multiple\npopulations have been investigated either from radial velocities of a\nrelatively-small sample of stars, or from relative proper motions of stars in\nthe small field of view provided by the Hubble Space Telescope. In this\ncontext, Gaia provides the unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of\nthousands GC stars over a wide field of view. For the first time, we combine\nGaia DR2 proper motions and multi-band photometry to study the internal motions\nof the two main stellar populations of 47 Tucanae in a wide field of view. We\nconfirm that this cluster exhibits high rotation on the plane of the sky and\nfind that both stellar generations share similar rotation patters.\nSecond-generation stars show stronger anisotropies and smaller\ntangential-velocity dispersion than the first generation, while there is no\nsignificant difference between their radial-velocity dispersion profiles. We\ndiscuss the impact of these results in the context of the formation scenarios\nfor multiple stellar populations in GCs.</td>

      <td>We investigate the nature of the double color-magnitude sequence observed in\nthe Gaia DR2 HR diagram of stars with high transverse velocities. The stars in\nthe reddest-color sequence are likely dominated by the dynamically-hot tail of\nthe thick disk population. Information from Nissen & Schuster (2010) and from\nthe APOGEE survey suggests that stars in the blue-color sequence have elemental\nabundance patterns that can be explained by this population having a relatively\nlow star-formation efficiency during its formation. In dynamical and orbital\nspaces, such as the `Toomre diagram', the two sequences show a significant\noverlap, but with a tendency for stars on the blue-color sequence to dominate\nregions with no or retrograde rotation and high total orbital energy. In the\nplane defined by the maximal vertical excursion of the orbits versus their\napocenters, stars of both sequences redistribute into discrete wedges. We\nconclude that stars which are typically assigned to the halo in the solar\nvicinity are actually both accreted stars lying along the blue sequence in the\nHR diagram, and the low velocity tail of the old Galactic disk, possibly\ndynamically heated by past accretion events. Our results imply that a halo\npopulation formed in situ and responsible for the early chemical enrichment\nprior to the formation of the thick disk is yet to be robustly identified, and\nthat what has been defined as the stars of the in situ stellar halo of the\nGalaxy may be in fact fossil records of its last significant merger.</td>

In spite of the significant distance\nuncertainties for stars in DR2 beyond 1.4 kpc, the spiral structure in the\nsolar neighborhood demonstrated by Gaia agrees well with that illustrated by\nVLBI maser results.

      <td>We measure the orbital properties of halo stars using 7-dimensional\ninformation provided by Gaia and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A metal-rich\npopulation of stars, present in both local main sequence stars and more distant\nblue horizontal branch stars, have very radial orbits (eccentricity ~ 0.9) and\napocenters that coincide with the stellar halo "break radius" at galactocentric\ndistance r ~ 20 kpc. Previous work has shown that the stellar halo density\nfalls off much more rapidly beyond this break radius. We argue that the\ncorrespondence between the apocenters of high metallicity, high eccentricity\nstars and the broken density profile is caused by the build-up of stars at the\napocenter of a common dwarf progenitor. Although the radially biased stars are\nlikely present down to metallicities of [Fe/H] ~ -2 the increasing dominance at\nhigher metallicities suggests a massive dwarf progenitor, which is at least as\nmassive as the Fornax and Sagittarius dwarf galaxies, and is likely the\ndominant progenitor of the inner stellar halo.</td>

      <td>A chemical and kinematical analysis of the intermediate-age open cluster IC 166 from APOGEE and Gaia DR2</td>
      <td>IC 166 is an intermediate-age open cluster ($\sim 1$ Gyr) which lies in the\ntransition zone of the metallicity gradient in the outer disc. Its location,\ncombined with our very limited knowledge of its salient features, make it an\ninteresting object of study. We present the first high-resolution spectroscopic\nand precise kinematical analysis of IC 166, which lies in the outer disc with\n$R_{GC} \sim 12.7$ kpc. High resolution \textit{H}-band spectra were analyzed\nusing observations from the SDSS-IV Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution\nExperiment (APOGEE) survey. We made use of the Brussels Automatic Stellar\nParameter (BACCHUS) code to provide chemical abundances based on a line-by-line\napproach for up to eight chemical elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Al, K, Mn and Fe).\nThe $\alpha-$element (Mg, Si, Ca and whenever available Ti) abundances, and\ntheir trends with Fe abundances have been analysed for a total of 13\nhigh-likelihood cluster members. No significant abundance scatter was found in\nany of the chemical species studied. Combining the positional, heliocentric\ndistance, and kinematic information we derive, for the first time, the probable\norbit of IC 166 within a Galactic model including a rotating boxy bar, and\nfound that it is likely that IC 166 formed in the Galactic disc, supporting its\nnature as an unremarkable Galactic open cluster with an orbit bound to the\nGalactic plane.</td>

      <td>We derive unbiased distance estimates for the Gaia-TGAS dataset by correcting\nfor the bias due to the distance dependence of the selection function, which we\nmeasure directly from the data. From these distances and proper motions, we\nestimate the vertical and azimuthal velocities, $W$ and $V_\phi$, and angular\nmomentum $L_z$ for stars in the Galactic centre and anti-centre directions. The\nresulting mean vertical motion $\overline{W}$ shows a linear increase with both\n$V_\phi$ and $L_z$ at $10 \sigma$ significance. Such a trend is expected from\nand consistent with the known Galactic warp. This signal extends to stars with\nguiding centre radii $R_g<R_0$, placing the onset of the warp at\n$R\lesssim7{\rm kpc}$. At equally high significance, we detect a previously\nunknown wave-like pattern of $\overline{W}$ over guiding centre $R_g$ with\namplitude $\sim1{\rm kms}^{-1}$ and wavelength $\sim2.5{\rm kpc}$. This pattern\nis present in both the centre and anti-centre directions, consistent with a\nwinding (corrugated) warp or bending wave, likely related to known features in\nthe outer disc (TriAnd and Monoceros over-densities), and may be caused by the\ninteraction with the Sgr dwarf galaxy $\sim1{\rm Gyr}$ ago. The only\nsignificant deviation from this simple fit is a stream-like feature near\n$R_g\sim9{\rm kpc}$ ($|L_z|\sim2150{\rm kpckms}^{-1}$).</td>

      <td>The GALAH survey: Co-orbiting stars and chemical tagging</td>
      <td>We present a study using the second data release of the GALAH survey of\nstellar parameters and elemental abundances of 15 pairs of stars identified by\nOh et al 2017. They identified these pairs as potentially co-moving pairs using\nproper motions and parallaxes from Gaia DR1. We find that 11 very wide (>1.7\npc) pairs of stars do in fact have similar Galactic orbits, while a further\nfour claimed co-moving pairs are not truly co-orbiting. Eight of the 11\nco-orbiting pairs have reliable stellar parameters and abundances, and we find\nthat three of those are quite similar in their abundance patterns, while five\nhave significant [Fe/H] differences. For the latter, this indicates that they\ncould be co-orbiting because of the general dynamical coldness of the thin\ndisc, or perhaps resonances induced by the Galaxy, rather than a shared\nformation site. Stars such as these, wide binaries, debris of past star\nformation episodes, and coincidental co-orbiters, are crucial for exploring the\nlimits of chemical tagging in the Milky Way.</td>

      <td>A Hierarchical Model for the Ages of Galactic Halo White Dwarfs</td>
      <td>In astrophysics, we often aim to estimate one or more parameters for each\nmember object in a population and study the distribution of the fitted\nparameters across the population. In this paper, we develop novel methods that\nallow us to take advantage of existing software designed for such case-by-case\nanalyses to simultaneously fit parameters of both the individual objects and\nthe parameters that quantify their distribution across the population. Our\nmethods are based on Bayesian hierarchical modelling which is known to produce\nparameter estimators for the individual objects that are on average closer to\ntheir true values than estimators based on case-by-case analyses. We verify\nthis in the context of estimating ages of Galactic halo white dwarfs (WDs) via\na series of simulation studies. Finally, we deploy our new techniques on\noptical and near-infrared photometry of ten candidate halo WDs to obtain\nestimates of their ages along with an estimate of the mean age of Galactic halo\nWDs of [11.25, 12.96] Gyr. Although this sample is small, our technique lays\nthe ground work for large-scale studies using data from the Gaia mission.</td>

Our method is based on\nself-organizing map (SOM), which is one of the most popular unsupervised\nlearning algorithms. StarGO combines SOM with a novel adaptive group\nidentification algorithm with essentially no free parameters. In order to\nevaluate our model, we build a synthetic stellar halo from mergers of nine\nsatellites in the Milky Way. We construct the mock catalogue by extracting a\nheliocentric volume of 10 kpc from our simulations and assigning expected\nobservational uncertainties corresponding to bright stars from Gaia DR2 and\nLAMOST DR5. We compare the results from StarGO against that from a\nFriends-of-Friends (FoF) based method in the space of orbital energy and\nangular momentum. We show that StarGO is able to systematically identify more\nsatellites and achieve higher number fraction of identified stars for most of\nthe satellites within the extracted volume. When applied to data from Gaia DR2,\nStarGO will enable us to reveal the origins of the inner stellar halo in\nunprecedented detail.</td>

The exquisite astrometry from Gaia reveals for the first time a\nbifurcation in the observed white dwarf sequence in both Gaia and the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) passbands. The latter is easily explained by a helium\natmosphere white dwarf fraction of 36%. However, the bifurcation in the Gaia\ncolour-magnitude diagram depends on both the atmospheric composition and the\nmass distribution. We simulate theoretical colour-magnitude diagrams for single\nand binary white dwarfs using a population synthesis approach and demonstrate\nthat there is a significant contribution from relatively massive white dwarfs\nthat likely formed through mergers. These include white dwarf remnants of\nmain-sequence (blue stragglers) and post-main sequence mergers. The mass\ndistribution of the SDSS subsample, including the spectroscopically confirmed\nwhite dwarfs, also shows this massive bump.

Integrating the past trajectories of LP 40-365, we confirm it crossed the\nGalactic disc 5.0 +/- 0.3 Myr ago in the direction of Carina, likely coming\nfrom beneath the plane. Finally, we estimate that LP 40-365 was ejected from\nits progenitor binary with a velocity of at least 600 km/s, which is compatible\nwith theoretical predictions for close binaries containing a white dwarf and a\nhelium-star donor.</td>

From the UVES spectra of cluster member stars, we determined the\naverage composition of clusters with ages >0.1 Gyr. We derived statistical ages\nand distances of field stars, and we separated them in thin and thick disc\npopulations. We studied the time evolution and dependence on metallicity of\nabundance ratios using open clusters and field stars. Using our large and\nhomogeneous sample of open clusters, thin and thick disc stars, spanning an age\nrange larger than 10 Gyr, we confirm an increase towards young ages of\ns-process abundances in the Solar neighbourhood. These trends are well defined\nfor open clusters and stars located nearby the solar position and they may be\nexplained by a late enrichment due to significant contribution to the\nproduction of these elements from long-living low-mass stars. At the same time,\nwe found a strong dependence of the s-process abundance ratios with the\nGalactocentric distance and with the metallicity of the clusters and field\nstars. Our results, derived from the largest and homogeneous sample of\ns-process abundances in the literature, confirm the growth with decreasing\nstellar ages of the s-process abundances in both field and open cluster stars.\nAt the same time, taking advantage of the abundances of open clusters located\nin a wide Galactocentric range, they open a new view on the dependence of the\ns-process evolution on the metallicity and star formation history, pointing to\ndifferent behaviours at various Galactocentric distances.</td>

Reliable (m-M)_V estimates yield M_V\nand M_bol values of comparable accuracy for binary stars because the V-band\nbolometric corrections applicable to them have no more than a weak dependence\non effective temperature (T_eff) and [Fe/H]. Chemical abundances derived from\nthe binary mass-M_V relations are independent of determinations based on their\nspectra. The temperatures of the binaries, which are calculated directly from\ntheir luminosities and the measured radii, completely rule out the low T_eff\nscale that has been determined for metal-deficient stars in some recent\nspectroscopic and interferometric studies. If [alpha/Fe] = 0.4 and [O/Fe] = 0.5\n+/- 0.1, we find that M55 has (m-M)_V = 13.95 +/- 0.05, [Fe/H] = -1.85 +/- 0.1,\nand an age of 12.9 +/- 0.8 Gyr, whereas NGC 6362 has (m-M)_V = 14.56 +/- 0.05,\n[Fe/H] = -0.90 +/- 0.1, and an age of 12.4 +/- 0.8 Gyr.

Here, we present a kinematic study of two outer halo GCs based\non a combination of VLT/FORS2, VLT/FLAMES, and Magellan/MIKE low- and\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy of 32 and 27 member stars, respectively. Although\nboth clusters are located at Galactocentric distances of 15 kpc, they have\notherwise very different properties. M 75 is a luminous and metal-rich system\nat [Fe/H] = $-1.2$ dex, a value that we confirm from the calcium triplet\nregion. This GC shows mild evidence for rotation with an amplitude of A$_{\rm\nrot}\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$. One of the most metal-poor GCs in the Milky Way (at\n[FeII/H] = $-2.3$ dex), NGC 6426 exhibits marginal evidence of internal\nrotation at the 2 km s$^{-1}$ level. Both objects have velocity dispersions\nthat are consistent with their luminosity. Although limited by small-number\nstatistics, the resulting limits on their $A_{\rm rot}/\sigma_0$ ratios suggest\nthat M 75 is a slow rotator driven by internal dynamics rather than being\neffected by the weak Galactic tides at its large distances. Here, M 75 ($A_{\rm\nrot}/\sigma=0.31$) is fully consistent with the properties of other, younger\nhalo clusters. At $A_{\rm rot}/\sigma_0=0.8\pm0.4$, NGC 6426 appears to have a\nremarkably ordered internal motion for its low metallicity, but the large\nuncertainty does not allow for an unambiguous categorization as a fast rotator.\nAn accretion origin of M 75 cannot be excluded, based on the eccentric orbit,\nwhich we derived from the recent data release 2 of Gaia, and considering its\nyounger age.</td>

Taken together with our recent discovery of a\nlong-period Cepheid in the starburst cluster VdBH222, these represent an\nimportant increase in the number of young, massive Cepheids known in Galactic\nopen clusters. We also consider new Gaia (data release 2) parallaxes and proper\nmotions for members of Be 51 and Be 55; the uncertainties on the parallaxes do\nnot allow us to refine our distance estimates to these clusters, but the\nwell-constrained proper motion measurements furnish further confirmation of\ncluster membership. However, future final Gaia parallaxes for such objects\nshould provide valuable independent distance measurements, improving the\ncalibration of the period-luminosity relationship, with implications for the\ndistance ladder out to cosmological scales.</td>

      <td>An Ultraviolet-Optical Color-Metallicity relation for Red Clump Stars using GALEX and Gaia</td>
      <td>Although core helium-burning red clump (RC) stars are faint at ultraviolet\nwavelengths, their ultraviolet-optical color is a unique and accessible probe\nof their physical properties. Using data from the GALEX All Sky Imaging Survey,\nGaia Data Release 2 and the SDSS APOGEE DR14 survey, we find that spectroscopic\nmetallicity is strongly correlated with the location of an RC star in the\nUV-optical color magnitude diagram. The RC has a wide spread in (NUV - G)$_0$\ncolor, over 4 magnitudes, compared to a 0.7-magnitude range in (G$_{BP}$ -\nG$_{RP}$)$_0$. We propose a photometric, dust-corrected, ultraviolet-optical\n(NUV - G)$_0$ color-metallicity [Fe/H] relation using a sample of 5,175 RC\nstars from APOGEE. We show that this relation has a scatter of 0.28 dex and is\neasier to obtain for large, wide-field samples than spectroscopic\nmetallicities. Importantly, the effect may be comparable to the spread in RC\ncolor attributed to extinction in other studies.</td>

Initial selection of the\nlow-metallicity targets was based on the stellar parameters published in RAVE\nData Releases 4 and 5. Follow-up was accomplished with the Gemini-N and\nGemini-S, the ESO/NTT, the KPNO/Mayall, and the SOAR telescopes. The wavelength\ncoverage for most of the observed spectra allows for the determination of\ncarbon and {\alpha}-element abundances, which are crucial for con- sidering the\nnature and frequency of the carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in this\nsample. We find that 88% of the observed stars have [Fe/H] <= -1.0, 61% have\n[Fe/H] <= -2.0, and 3% have [Fe/H] <= -3.0 (with four stars at [Fe/H] <= -3.5).\nThere are 306 CEMP star candidates in this sample, and we identify 169 CEMP\nGroup I, 131 CEMP Group II, and 6 CEMP Group III stars from the A(C) vs. [Fe/H]\ndiagram. Inspection of the [alpha/C] abundance ratios reveals that five of the\nCEMP Group II stars can be classified as "mono-enriched second-generation"\nstars. Gaia DR1 matches were found for 734 stars, and we show that transverse\nvelocities can be used as a confirmatory selection criteria for low-metallicity\ncandidates. Selected stars from our validated list are being followed-up with\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy, to reveal their full chemical abundance patterns\nfor further studies.</td>

In the present\ncontribution we introduce the algorithm, lay out the ideas behind it, explain\nthe methodology adopted to detect streams and detail its workings by running it\non a suite of simulations of mock Galactic survey data of similar quality to\nthat expected from the ESA/Gaia mission. We show that our algorithm is able to\ndetect even ultra-faint stream features lying well below previous detection\nlimits. Tests show that our algorithm will be able to detect distant halo\nstream structures $>10^{\circ}$ long containing as few as $\sim 15$ members\n($\Sigma_{\rm G} \sim 33.6\, {\rm mag \, arcsec^{-2}}$) in the Gaia dataset.</td>

      <td>Leaves on trees: identifying halo stars with extreme gradient boosted trees</td>
      <td>Extended stellar haloes are a natural by-product of the hierarchical\nformation of massive galaxies. If merging is a non-negligible factor in the\ngrowth of our Galaxy, evidence of such events should be encoded in its stellar\nhalo. Reliable identification of genuine halo stars is a challenging task\nhowever. The 1st Gaia data release contains the positions, parallaxes and\nproper motions for over 2 million stars, mostly in the Solar neighbourhood.\nGaia DR2 will enlarge this sample to over 1.5 billion stars, the brightest ~5\nmillion of which will have a full phase-space information. Our aim is to\ndevelop a machine learning model to reliably identify halo stars, even when\ntheir full phase-space information is not available. We use the Gradient\nBoosted Trees algorithm to build a supervised halo star classifier. The\nclassifier is trained on a sample extracted from the Gaia Universe Model\nSnapshot, convolved with the errors of TGAS, as well as with the expected\nuncertainties of the upcoming Gaia DR2. We also trained our classifier on the\ncross-match between the TGAS and RAVE catalogues, where the halo stars are\nlabelled in an entirely model independent way. We then use this model to\nidentify halo stars in TGAS. When full phase- space information is available\nand for Gaia DR2-like uncertainties, our classifier is able to recover 90% of\nthe halo stars with at most 30% distance errors, in a completely unseen test\nset, and with negligible levels of contamination. When line-of-sight velocity\nis not available, we recover ~60% of such halo stars, with less than 10%\ncontamination. When applied to the TGAS data, our classifier detects 337 high\nconfidence RGB halo stars. Although small, this number is consistent with the\nexpectation from models given the data uncertainties. The large parallax errors\nare the biggest limitation to identify a larger number of halo stars in all the\ncases studied.</td>

We detect 76 runaway stars, 17\n(possibly 19) of them with no prior identification as such, with an estimated\ndetection rate of approximately one half of the real runaway fraction. An age\neffect appears to be present, with objects of spectral subtype B1 and later\nhaving travelled for longer distances than runaways of earlier subtypes. We\nalso tentatively propose that the fraction of runaways is lower among BA\nsupergiants that among O stars but further studies using future Gaia data\nreleases are needed to confirm this. The frequency of fast rotators is high\namong runaway O stars, which indicates that a significant fraction of them (and\npossibly a majority) is produced in supernova explosions.</td>

One major cause of inhomogeneities in the abundances\nof open clusters is stellar evolution of the cluster members. In this work, we\ninvestigate variations in the surface chemical composition of member stars of\nthe old open cluster M67 as a possible consequence of atomic diffusion effects\ntaking place during the main-sequence phase. The abundances used are obtained\nfrom high-resolution UVES/FLAMES spectra within the framework of the Gaia-ESO\nSurvey. We find that the surface abundances of stars on the main sequence\ndecrease with increasing mass reaching a minimum at the turn-off. After\ndeepening of the convective envelope in sub-giant branch stars, the initial\nsurface abundances are restored. We found the measured abundances to be\nconsistent with the predictions of stellar evolutionary models for a cluster\nwith the age and metallicity of M67. Our findings indicate that atomic\ndiffusion poses a non-negligible constraint on the achievable precision of\nchemical tagging methods.</td>

In\naddition, ages for RAVE stars are determined using a Bayesian method, taking\nTGAS parallaxes as a prior. We divide our sample into young ($0 < \tau < 3$\nGyr) and old ($8 < \tau < 13$ Gyr) populations, and then consider different\nmetallicity bins for each of these age groups. We find significant differences\nin kinematic trends of young and old, metal-poor and metal-rich, stellar\npopulations. In particular, we find a strong metallicity dependence in the mean\nGalactocentric radial velocity as a function of radius ($\partial {V_{\rm\nR}}/\partial R$) for young stars, with metal-rich stars having a much steeper\ngradient than metal-poor stars. For $\partial {V_{\phi}}/\partial R$, young,\nmetal-rich stars significantly lag the LSR with a slightly positive gradient,\nwhile metal-poor stars show a negative gradient above the LSR.

We develop a\ndynamical criterion based on the distribution function of stars in various\nGalactic components, using action integrals to identify halo members, and\ncompare this to metallicity and to kinematically selected samples. With this\nnew method, we find 1156 stars in the Solar Neighbourhood to be likely members\nof the stellar halo. Our dynamically selected sample consists mainly of distant\ngiants on elongated orbits. Their metallicity distribution is rather broad,\nwith roughly half of the stars having [M/H] $\ge -1$ dex. The use of different\nselection criteria has an important impact on the characteristics of the\nvelocity distributions obtained. Nonetheless, for our dynamically selected and\nfor the metallicity selected samples, we find the local velocity ellipsoid to\nbe aligned in spherical coordinates in a Galactocentric reference frame: this\nsuggests that the total gravitational potential is rather spherical in the\nregion spanned by the orbits of the halo stars in these samples.</td>

      <td>Evidence for Halo Kinematics among Cool Carbon-Rich Dwarfs</td>
      <td>This paper reports preliminary yet compelling kinematical inferences for N ~\n600 carbon-rich dwarf stars that demonstrate around 30% to 60% are members of\nthe Galactic halo. The study uses a spectroscopically and non-kinematically\nselected sample of stars from the SDSS, and cross-correlates these data with\nthree proper motion catalogs based on Gaia DR1 astrometry to generate estimates\nof their 3-D space velocities. The fraction of stars with halo-like kinematics\nis roughly 30% for distances based on a limited number of parallax\nmeasurements, with the remainder dominated by the thick disk, but close to 60%\nof the sample lie below an old, metal-poor disk isochrone in reduced proper\nmotion. An ancient population is consistent with an extrinsic origin for C/O >1\nin cool dwarfs, where a fixed mass of carbon pollution more readily surmounts\nlower oxygen abundances, and with a lack of detectable ultraviolet-blue flux\nfrom younger white dwarf companions. For an initial stellar mass function that\nfavors low-mass stars as in the Galactic disk, the dC stars are likely to be\nthe dominant source of carbon-enhanced, metal-poor stars in the Galaxy.</td>

      <td>The Milky Way Halo in Action Space</td>
      <td>We analyse the structure of the local stellar halo of the Milky Way using\n$\sim$ 60000 stars with full phase space coordinates extracted from the\nSDSS--{\it Gaia} catalogue. We display stars in action space as a function of\nmetallicity in a realistic axisymmetric potential for the Milky Way Galaxy. The\nmetal-rich population is more distended towards high radial action $J_R$ as\ncompared to azimuthal or vertical action, $J_\phi$ or $J_z$. It has a mild\nprograde rotation $(\langle v_\phi \rangle \approx 25$ km s$^{-1}$), is\nradially anisotropic and highly flattened with axis ratio $q \approx 0.6 -\n0.7$. The metal-poor population is more evenly distributed in all three\nactions. It has larger prograde rotation $(\langle v_\phi \rangle \approx 50$\nkm s$^{-1}$), a mild radial anisotropy and a roundish morphology ($q\approx\n0.9$). We identify two further components of the halo in action space. There is\na high energy, retrograde component that is only present in the metal-rich\nstars. This is suggestive of an origin in a retrograde encounter, possibly the\none that created the stripped dwarf galaxy nucleus, $\omega$Centauri. Also\nvisible as a distinct entity in action space is a resonant component, which is\nflattened and prograde. It extends over a range of metallicities down to [Fe/H]\n$\approx -3$. It has a net outward radial velocity $\langle v_R \rangle \approx\n12$ km s$^{-1}$ within the Solar circle at $|z| <3.5$ kpc. The existence of\nresonant stars at such extremely low metallicities has not been seen before.</td>

      <td>Dynamical Ages of the Young Local Associations with $\textit{Gaia}$</td>
      <td>The Young Local Associations constitute an excellent sample for the study of\na variety of astrophysical topics, especially the star formation process in\nlow-density environments. Data from the Gaia mission allows us to undertake\nstudies of the YLAs with unprecedented accuracy. We determine the dynamical age\nand place of birth of a set of associations in a uniform and dynamically\nconsistent manner. There are nine YLAs in our sample $\epsilon$ Chamaeleontis,\nTW Hydrae, $\beta$ Pictoris, Octans, Tucana-Horologium, Columba, Carina, Argus\nand AB Doradus. We designed a method for deriving the dynamical age of the YLAs\nbased on the orbital integration. It involves a strategy to account for the\neffect of observational errors and we tested it using mock YLAs. Finally, we\napplied it to our set of nine YLAs with astrometry from the first Gaia data\nrelease and complementary on-ground radial velocities from the literature. Our\norbital analysis yields a first estimate of the dynamical age of 3$^{+9}_{-0}$\nMyr, 13$^{+7}_{-0}$ Myr and 5$^{+23}_{-0}$ Myr for $\epsilon$ Cha, $\beta$ Pict\nand Tuc-Hor, respectively. For four other associations (Oct, Col, Car and Arg),\nwe provide a lower limit for the dynamical age. Our rigorous error treatment\nindicates that TW Hya and AB Dor deserve further study. Our dynamical ages are\ncompatible spectroscopic and isochrone fitting ages obtained elsewhere. From\nthe orbital analysis, we suggest a scenario with two episodes of star\nformation: one ~40 Myr ago in the first quadrant that gave birth to $\epsilon$\nCha, TW Hya and $\beta$ Pic, and another 5-15 Myr ago close to the Sun that\nformed Tuc-Hor, Col, and Car. Future Gaia data will provide the necessary\naccuracy to improve the present results, especially for the controversial age\ndeterminations, and additional evidence for the proposed scenario, once a\ncomplete census of YLAs and better membership can be obtained.</td>

One such stream, Hercules, has been proposed to result from the outer\nLindblad resonance (OLR) of a short fast rotating bar as shown analytically, or\nthe corotation resonance (CR) of a longer slower rotating bar as observed in an\nN-body model. We show that by including an m = 4 Fourier component in an\nanalytical long bar model, with an amplitude that is typical for bars in N-body\nsimulations, we can reproduce a Hercules like feature in the kinematics of the\nSolar neighbourhood.

      <td>Predicting the hypervelocity star population in Gaia</td>
      <td>Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are amongst the fastest objects in our Milky Way.\nThese stars are predicted to come from the Galactic center (GC) and travel\nalong unbound orbits across the Galaxy. In the coming years, the ESA satellite\nGaia will provide the most complete and accurate catalogue of the Milky Way,\nwith full astrometric parameters for more than $1$ billion stars. In this\npaper, we present the expected sample size and properties (mass, magnitude,\nspatial, velocity distributions) of HVSs in the Gaia stellar catalogue. We\nbuild three Gaia mock catalogues of HVSs anchored to current observations,\nexploring different ejection mechanisms and GC stellar population properties.\nIn all cases, we predict hundreds to thousands of HVSs with precise proper\nmotion measurements within a few tens of kpc from us. For stars with a relative\nerror in total proper motion below $10 \%$, the mass range extends to ~$10\nM_{\odot}$ but peaks at ~$1$ $M_\odot$. The majority of Gaia HVSs will\ntherefore probe a different mass and distance range compared to the current\nnon-Gaia sample. In addition, a subset of a few hundreds to a few thousands of\nHVSs with $M$ ~ $3$ $M_\odot$ will be bright enough to have a precise\nmeasurement of the three-dimensional velocity from Gaia alone. Finally, we show\nthat Gaia will provide more precise proper motion measurements for the current\nsample of HVS candidates. This will help identifying their birthplace narrowing\ndown their ejection location, and confirming or rejecting their nature as HVSs.\nOverall, our forecasts are extremely encouraging in terms of quantity and\nquality of HVS data that can be exploited to constrain both the Milky Way\npotential and the GC properties.</td>

      <td>We investigate the kinematics of red clump stars in the Solar Neighbourhood\nby combining data from TGAS and RAVE to constrain the local dark matter\ndensity. After calibrating the absolute magnitude of red clump stars, we\ncharacterize their velocity distribution over a radial distance range of\n$6$-$10$ kpc and up to $1.5$ kpc away from the Galactic plane. We then apply\nthe axisymmetric Jeans equations on subsets representing the thin and thick\ndisks to determine the (local) distribution of mass near the disk of our\nGalaxy. Our kinematic maps are well-behaved permitting a straightforward local\ndetermination of the vertical force, which we find to be $K_z^{\rm thin} =\n-2454 \pm 619$ and $K_z^{\rm thick} = -2141 \pm 774$ $(\mathrm{km/s})^2 \!\n/\mathrm{kpc}$ at $1.5$ kpc away from the Galactic plane for the thin and thick\ndisk samples and for thin and thick disk scale heights of 0.28 kpc and 1.12 kpc\nrespectively. These measurements can be translated into a local dark matter\ndensity $\rho_\textrm{DM} \sim 0.018 \pm 0.002 M_\odot/\textrm{pc}^3$. The\nsystematic error on this estimate is much larger than the quoted statistical\nerror, since even a 10% difference in the scale height of the thin disk leads\nto a 30% change in the value of $\rho_\textrm{DM}$, and a nearly equally good\nfit to the data.</td>

We search in particular for variation in all three\nvelocity components with distance above and below the disc midplane, as well as\nhow each component of Vz (line-of-sight and tangential velocity projections)\nmodifies the obtained vertical structure. To study the dependence of velocity\non proper motion and distance we use two main samples: a RAVE sample including\nproper motions from the Tycho-2, PPMXL and UCAC4 catalogues, and a RAVE-TGAS\nsample with inferred distances and proper motions from the TGAS and UCAC5\ncatalogues. In both samples, we identify asymmetries in VR and Vz. Below the\nplane we find the largest radial gradient to be dVR / dR = -7.01+- 0.61 km\s\nkpc, in agreement with recent studies. Above the plane we find a similar\ngradient with dVR / dR= -9.42+- 1.77 km\s kpc. By comparing our results with\nprevious studies, we find that the structure in Vz is strongly dependent on the\nadopted proper motions. Using the Galaxia Milky Way model, we demonstrate that\ndistance uncertainties can create artificial wave-like patterns. In contrast to\nprevious suggestions of a breathing mode seen in RAVE data, our results support\na combination of bending and breathing modes, likely generated by a combination\nof external or internal and external mechanisms.</td>

      <td>The velocity anisotropy parameter, beta, is a measure of the kinematic state\nof orbits in the stellar halo which holds promise for constraining the merger\nhistory of the Milky Way (MW). We determine global trends for beta as a\nfunction of radius from three suites of simulations, including accretion only\nand cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that both types of\nsimulations are consistent and predict strong radial anisotropy (<beta>~0.7)\nfor Galactocentric radii greater than 10 kpc. Previous observations of beta for\nthe MW's stellar halo claim a detection of an isotropic or tangential "dip" at\nr~20 kpc. Using the N-body+SPH simulations, we investigate the temporal\npersistence, population origin, and severity of "dips" in beta. We find dips in\nthe in situ stellar halo are long-lived, while dips in the accreted stellar\nhalo are short-lived and tied to the recent accretion of satellite material. We\nalso find that a major merger as early as z~1 can result in a present day low\n(isotropic to tangential) value of beta over a wide range of radii and angular\nexpanse. While all of these mechanisms are plausible drivers for the beta dip\nobserved in the MW, in the simulations, each mechanism has a unique metallicity\nsignature associated with it, implying that future spectroscopic surveys could\ndistinguish between them. Since an accurate knowledge of beta(r) is required\nfor measuring the mass of the MW halo, we note significant transient dips in\nbeta could cause an overestimate of the halo's mass when using spherical Jeans\nequation modeling.</td>

It rests upon a\nconverging inflow of molecular gas building up a first population of pre-main\nsequence stars. The associated just-formed O stars ionise the inflow and\nsuppress star formation in the embedded cluster. However, they typically eject\neach other out of the embedded cluster within 10^6 yr, that is before the\nmolecular cloud filament can be ionised entirely. The inflow of molecular gas\ncan then resume forming a second population. This sequence of events can be\nrepeated multiply. This model is applied to the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), in\nwhich three well-separated pre-main sequences in the color-magnitude diagram of\nthe cluster have recently been discovered. The mass-inflow history is\nconstrained using this model and the number of OB stars ejected from each\npopulation are estimated for verification using Gaia data. As a consequence of\nthe proposed model, the three runaway O star systems, AE Aur, mu Col and iota\nOri, are considered as significant observational evidence for stellar-dynamical\nejections of massive stars from the oldest population in the ONC.</td>

The observations are part of the ongoing near-infrared VISTA survey of\nthe Magellanic Cloud system (VMC). The data analyzed here corresponds to one\nVMC tile and covers a total sky area of 1.77 deg^2. Absolute proper motions\nwith respect to ~9070 background galaxies are calculated from a linear\nregression model applied to the stellar positions in 11 epochs in the Ks\nfilter. The data extend over a total time baseline of ~17 months. We found a\nmedian proper motion of the stars within 47 Tuc of (mu_a cos(d), mu_d) = (+5.89\n+/- 0.02(stat) +/- 0.13(sys), -2.14 +/- 0.02(stat) +/- 0.08(sys)) mas/yr, based\non the measurements of ~35000 individual sources between 5' and 42' from the\ncluster center. We compared our result to the proper motions from the newest US\nNaval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC5) which includes data from the\nGaia data release 1. Selecting cluster members (~2700 stars) we found a median\nproper motion of (mu_a cos(d), mu_d) = (+5.30 +/- 0.03(stat) +/- 0.70(sys),\n-2.70 +/- 0.03(stat) +/- 0.70(sys)) mas/yr. The values derived from the VMC\ndata are consistent with the UCAC5 result, and are close to literature\nmeasurements obtained using HST. We combined our results with literature radial\nvelocity measurements and reconstructed the orbit of 47 Tuc, finding that the\ncluster is on a low-ellipticity orbit and is confined within the inner ~7.5 kpc\nof the Galaxy. We show that the use of an increased time baseline combined with\nPSF-determined stellar centroids in crowded regions significantly improves the\naccuracy of the method. In future works, we will apply this method to more VMC\ntiles to study in detail the kinematics of the Magellanic Clouds.</td>

      <td>The vertical metallicity gradients of mono-age stellar populations in the Milky Way with the RAVE and Gaia data</td>
      <td>We investigate the vertical metallicity gradients of five mono-age stellar\npopulations between 0 and 11 Gyr for a sample of 18 435 dwarf stars selected\nfrom the cross-matched Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) and RAdial\nVelocity Experiment (RAVE) Data Release 5. We find a correlation between the\nvertical metallicity gradients and age, with no vertical metallicity gradient\nin the youngest population and an increasingly steeper negative vertical\nmetallicity gradient for the older stellar populations. The metallicity at disc\nplane remains almost constant between 2 and 8 Gyr, and it becomes significantly\nlower for the $8 < \tau \leqslant 11$ Gyr population. The current analysis also\nreveals that the intrinsic dispersion in metallicity increases steadily with\nage. We discuss that our results are consistent with a scenario that (thin)\ndisc stars formed from a flaring (thin) star-forming disc.</td>

      <td>The HST large programme on $Ï$ Centauri -- III. Absolute proper motion</td>
      <td>In this paper we report a new estimate of the absolute proper motion (PM) of\nthe globular cluster NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen) as part of the HST large program\nGO-14118+14662. We analyzed a field 17 arcmin South-West of the center of\n$\omega$ Cen and computed PMs with an epoch span of $\sim$15.1 years. We\nemployed 45 background galaxies to link our relative PMs to an absolute\nreference-frame system. The absolute PM of the cluster in our field is:\n$(\mu_\alpha \cos\delta , \mu_\delta) = (-3.341 \pm 0.028 , -6.557 \pm 0.043)$\nmas yr$^{-1}$. Upon correction for the effects of viewing perspective and the\nknown cluster rotation, this implies that for the cluster center of mass\n$(\mu_\alpha \cos\delta , \mu_\delta) = (-3.238 \pm 0.028, -6.716 \pm 0.043)$\nmas yr$^{-1}$. This measurement is direct and independent, has the highest\nrandom and systematic accuracy to date, and will provide an external\nverification for the upcoming Gaia Data Release 2. It also differs from most\nreported PMs for $\omega$ Cen in the literature by more than 5$\sigma$, but\nconsistency checks compared to other recent catalogs yield excellent agreement.\nWe computed the corresponding Galactocentric velocity, calculated the implied\norbit of $\omega$ Cen in two different Galactic potentials, and compared these\norbits to the orbits implied by one of the PM measurements available in the\nliterature. We find a larger (by about 500 pc) perigalactic distance for\n$\omega$ Cen with our new PM measurement, suggesting a larger survival\nexpectancy for the cluster in the Galaxy.</td>

In this study we\nemploy precise ground based photometry from the private collection of Stetson,\nspace photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope, literature abundances of Na\nand O, and APOGEE survey abundances for Mg, Al, C, and N. Multiple populations\nare identified by their position in the CU,B,I -V pseudo-CMD and confirmed with\ntheir chemical composition determined using abundances. We confirm the\nexpectation from previous studies that the RGB in all seven clusters are split\nand the different branches have different chemical compositions. The Mg-Al\nanti-correlations were well explored by the APOGEE and Gaia-ESO surveys for\nmost globular clusters, some clusters showing bimodal distributions, while\nothers continuous distributions. Even though the structure (i.e., bimodal vs.\ncontinuous) of Mg-Al can greatly vary, the Al-rich and Al-poor populations do\nnot seem to have very different photometric properties, agreeing with\ntheoretical calculations. There is no one-to-one correspondence between the\nMg-Al anticorrelation shape (bimodal vs. continuous) and the structure of the\nRGB seen in the HST pseudo-CMDs, with the HST photometric information usually\nimplying more complex formation/evolution histories than the spectroscopic\nones.

The stars are\nseparated into metal-poor (${\rm [Fe/H]<-0.2}$\,dex and metal-rich (${\rm\n[Fe/H]>-0.2}$\,dex) groups, so that the metal-rich stars are mostly\n$\alpha$-poor, while the metal-poor group are mostly contributed by\n$\alpha$-enhanced stars. Thus, the old and metal-poor stars likely belong to\nthe chemically defined thick disc population, while the metal-rich sample is\ndominated by the thin disc. The AVR for the metal-poor sample shows an abrupt\nincrease at $\gtrsim7$\,Gyr, which is contributed by the thick disc component.\nOn the other hand, most of the thin disc stars with ${\rm [Fe/H]>-0.2}$\,dex\ndisplay a power-law like AVR with indices of about 0.3--0.4 and 0.5 for the\nin-plane and vertical dispersions, respectively. This is consistent with the\nscenario that the disc is gradually heated by the spiral arms and/or the giant\nmolecular clouds. Moreover, the older thin disc stars ($>7$\,Gyr) have a\nrounder velocity ellipsoid, i.e. $\sigma_\phi/\sigma_{\rm z}$ is close to 1.0,\nprobably due to the more efficient heating in vertical direction. Particularly\nfor the old metal-poor sample located with $|z|>270$\,pc, the vertical\ndispersion is even larger than its azimuthal counterpart. Finally, the vertex\ndeviations and the tilt angles are plausibly around zero with large\nuncertainties.</td>

These stars have accurate astrometric information from\n\textit{Gaia}/DR1, providing reliable age estimates with relative uncertainties\nof $\pm1-2$ Gyr and allowing precise orbital determinations. The sample is\nsplit based on chemistry into a low-[Mg/Fe] sequence, which are often\nidentified as thin disk stellar populations, and a high-[Mg/Fe] sequence, which\nare often associated with the thick disk. We find that the high-[Mg/Fe]\nchemical sequence has extended star formation for several Gyr and is coeval\nwith the oldest stars of the low-[Mg/Fe] chemical sequence: both the low- and\nhigh-[Mg/Fe] sequences were forming stars at the same time. The high-[Mg/Fe]\nstellar populations are only vertically extended for the oldest, most-metal\npoor and highest [Mg/Fe] stars. When comparing vertical velocity dispersion for\nboth sequences, the high-[Mg/Fe] sequence has lower velocity dispersion than\nthe low-[Mg/Fe] sequence for stars of similar age. Identifying either group as\nthin or thick disk based on chemistry is misleading. The stars belonging to the\nhigh-[Mg/Fe] sequence have perigalacticons that originate in the inner disk,\nwhile the perigalacticons of stars on the low-[Mg/Fe] sequence are generally\naround the solar neighborhood. From the orbital properties of the stars, the\nhigh-and low-[Mg/Fe] sequences are most likely a reflection of the chemical\nenrichment history of the inner and outer disk populations; radial mixing\ncauses both populations to be observed in situ at the solar position. Based on\nthese results, we emphasize that it is important to be clear in defining what\npopulations are being referenced when using the terms thin and thick disk, and\nthat ideally the term thick disk should be reserved for purely geometric\ndefinitions to avoid confusion and be consistent with definitions in external\ngalaxies.</td>

      <td>Transient spiral arms from far out of equilibrium gravitational evolution</td>
      <td>We describe how a simple class of out of equilibrium, rotating and\nasymmetrical mass distributions evolve under their self-gravity to produce a\nquasi-planar spiral structure surrounding a virialized core, qualitatively\nresembling a spiral galaxy. The spiral structure is transient, but can survive\ntens of dynamical times, and further reproduces qualitatively noted features of\nspiral galaxies as the predominance of trailing two-armed spirals and large\npitch angles. As our models are highly idealized, a detailed comparison with\nobservations is not appropriate, but generic features of the velocity\ndistributions can be identified to be potential observational signatures of\nsuch a mechanism. Indeed, the mechanism leads generically to a characteristic\ntransition from predominantly rotational motion, in a region outside the core,\nto radial ballistic motion in the outermost parts. Such radial motions are\nexcluded in our Galaxy up to 15 kpc, but could be detected at larger scales in\nthe future by GAIA. We explore the apparent motions seen by external observers\nof the velocity distributions of our toy galaxies, and find that it is\ndifficult to distinguish them from those of a rotating disc with sub-dominant\nradial motions at levels typically inferred from observations. These simple\nmodels illustrate the possibility that the observed apparent motions of spiral\ngalaxies might be explained by non-trivial non-stationary mass and velocity\ndistributions without invoking a dark matter halo or modification of Newtonian\ngravity. In this scenario the observed phenomenological relation between the\ncentripetal and gravitational acceleration of the visible baryonic mass could\nhave a simple explanation.</td>

We combine this in a Gibbs sampler with\nsamplers for the nuisance and potential parameters to explore the uncertainty\ndistribution of the full set of parameters. We illustrate our M2M improvements\nby modeling the vertical density and kinematics of F-type stars in Gaia DR1.\nThe novel M2M method proposed here allows full probabilistic modeling of\nsteady-state dynamical systems, allowing uncertainties on the non-parametric\ndistribution function and on nuisance parameters to be taken into account when\nconstraining the dark and baryonic masses of stellar systems.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Churning through the Milky Way</td>

We investigate the kinematic\nproperties, such as velocity dispersion and orbital parameters, of stellar\npopulations near the sun as a function of [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H], which could show\nevidence of a major merger in the past history of the Milky Way. This was done\nusing the stellar parameters from the Gaia-ESO Survey along with proper motions\nfrom PPMXL to determine distances, kinematics, and orbital properties for these\nstars to analyze the chemodynamic properties of stellar populations near the\nSun. Analyzing the kinematics of the most metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]$>0.1$), we\nfind that more than half have small eccentricities ($e<0.2$) or are on nearly\ncircular orbits. Slightly more than 20\% of the metal-rich stars have\nperigalacticons $R_p>7$ kpc. We find that the highest [Mg/Fe], metal-poor\npopulations have lower vertical and radial velocity dispersions compared to\nlower [Mg/Fe] populations of similar metallicity by $\sim10$ km s$^{-1}$. The\nmedian eccentricity increases linearly with [Mg/Fe] across all metallicities,\nwhile the perigalacticon decreases with increasing [Mg/Fe] for all\nmetallicities. Finally, the most [Mg/Fe]-rich stars are found to have\nsignificant asymmetric drift and rotate more than 40 km s$^{-1}$ slower than\nstars with lower [Mg/Fe] ratios. While our results cannot constrain how far\nstars have migrated, we propose that migration processes are likely to have\nplayed an important role in the evolution of the Milky Way, with metal-rich\nstars migrating from the inner disk toward to solar neighborhood and past\nmergers potentially driving enhanced migration of older stellar populations in\nthe disk.</td>

We study the morphology of the stellar\nhalo by analysing the RR Lyrae distribution with parametric and non-parametric\ntechniques. Taking advantage of the uniform all-sky coverage, we test halo\nmodels more sophisticated than usually considered in the literature, such as\nthose with varying flattening, tilt and/or offset of the halo with respect to\nthe Galactic disc. A consistent picture emerges: the inner halo is well\nreproduced by a smooth distribution of stars settled on triaxial ellipsoids.\nThe minor axis is perpendicular to the Milky Ways disc, while the major axis is\nmisaligned by $\sim20^{\circ}$ from the Galactic Y axis. The elongation along\nthe major axis is mild ($\text{p}=1.27$), and the vertical flattening is shown\nto evolve from a squashed state with $\text{q}\approx0.57$ in the centre to a\nmore spherical $\text{q}\approx0.75$ at the outer edge of our dataset. The\ndensity slope is well approximated by a single power-law with exponent\n$\alpha=-2.96$.

Inputting these dispersions into the\nlinear Str\"omberg relation for the thin disc groups, we find the Sun's\nvelocity with respect to the LSR in Galactic rotation to be V_{\sun} = 13.9 \pm\n3.4 km s^{-1}. A relation is found between the vertex deviation and the\nchemical abundances for the thin disc, ranging from -5 to +40^{\circ} as\niron-abundance increases. For the thick disc we find a vertex deviation of\nl_{uv} \sim -15^{\circ}. The tilt angle (l_{uw}) in the U-W plane for the thin\ndisc groups ranges from -10 to +15^\circ, but there is no evident relation\nbetween l_{uw} and the mean abundances. However we find a weak relation for\nl_{uw} as a function of iron abundances and \alpha-elements for most of the\ngroups in the thick disc, where the tilt angle decreases from -5 to -20^\circ\nwhen [Fe/H] decreases and [\alpha/Fe] increases. The velocity anisotropy\nparameter is independent of the chemical group abundances and its value is\nnearly constant for both discs (\beta \sim 0.5), suggesting that the combined\ndisc is dynamically relaxed.</td>

Using RAVE and LAMOST metallicities and RAVE\nMg, Al, Si, Ti, and Fe abundances, we find that the differences in the\nmetallicities and elemental abundances of components of wide binaries are\nconsistent with being due to observational uncertainties, in agreement with\nprevious results for smaller and more restricted samples. The metallicity and\nelemental abundance consistency between wide binary components presented in\nthis work confirms their common origin and bolsters the status of wide binaries\nas "mini-open clusters." Furthermore, this is evidence that wide binaries are\neffectively co-eval and co-chemical, supporting their use for e.g.,\nconstraining age-activity-rotation relations, the initial-final mass relation\nfor white dwarfs, and M-dwarf metallicity indicators. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that the common proper motion, common parallax pairs in TGAS with\nthe most extreme separations (s $\gtrsim$ 0.1 pc) typically have inconsistent\nmetallicities, radial velocities or both and are therefore likely to be\npredominantly comprised of random alignments of unassociated stars with similar\nastrometry, in agreement with our previous results. Finally, we propose that\nwide binaries form an ideal data set with which to test chemical tagging as a\nmethod to identify stars of common origin, particularly because the stars in\nwide binaries span a wide range of metallicities, much wider than that spanned\nby nearby open clusters.</td>

The Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS)\ncatalogue, which is a part of Gaia data release 1 (Gaia DR1), delivers accurate\ntrigonometric parallax measurements for more than 2 million stars, including\nthose in star clusters. We compare the open cluster photometric distance scale\nwith the measurements given by the trigonometric parallaxes from TGAS to\nevaluate the consistency between these values. The average parallaxes of\nprobable cluster members available in TGAS provide the trigonometric distance\nscale of open clusters, while the photometric scale is given by the distances\npublished in the MWSC. Sixty-four clusters are suited for comparison as they\nhave more than 16 probable members with parallax measurements in TGAS. We\ncomputed the average parallaxes of the probable members and compared these to\nthe photometric parallaxes derived within the MWSC. We find a good agreement\nbetween the trigonometric TGAS-based and the photometric MWSC-based distance\nscales of open clusters, which for distances less than 2.3 kpc coincide at a\nlevel of about 0.1 mas with no dependence on the distance. If at all, there is\na slight systematic offset along the Galactic equator between $30^\circ$ and\n$160^\circ$ galactic longitude.</td>

      <td>A Gaia-PS1-SDSS (GPS1) Proper Motion Catalog Covering 3/4 of the Sky</td>
      <td>We combine Gaia DR1, PS1, SDSS and 2MASS astrometry to measure proper motions\nfor 350 million sources across three-fourths of the sky down to a magnitude of\n$m_r\sim20$\,. Using positions of galaxies from PS1, we build a common\nreference frame for the multi-epoch PS1, single-epoch SDSS and 2MASS data, and\ncalibrate the data in small angular patches to this frame. As the Gaia DR1\nexcludes resolved galaxy images, we choose a different approach to calibrate\nits positions to this reference frame: we exploit the fact that the proper\nmotions of stars in these patches are {\it linear}. By simultaneously fitting\nthe positions of stars at different epochs of -- Gaia DR1, PS1, SDSS, and 2MASS\n-- we construct an extensive catalog of proper motions dubbed GPS1. GPS1 has a\ncharacteristic systematic error of less than 0.3 \masyr\, and a typical\nprecision of $ 1.5-2.0$\masyr. The proper motions have been validated using\ngalaxies, open clusters, distant giant stars and QSOs. In comparison with other\npublished faint proper motion catalogs, GPS1's systematic error ($<0.3$ \masyr)\nshould be nearly an order of magnitude better than that of PPMXL and UCAC4\n($>2.0$ \masyr). Similarly, its precision ($\sim 1.5$ \masyr) is a four-fold\nimprovement relative to PPMXL and UCAC4 ($\sim 6.0$ \masyr). For QSOs, the\nprecision of GPS1 is found to be worse ($\sim 2.0-3.0$\masyr), possibly due to\ntheir particular differential chromatic refraction (DCR). The GPS1 catalog will\nbe released on-line and available via the VizieR Service and VO Service.\n(===GPS1 is available with VO TAP Query now, see\nhttp://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/~tian/GPS1/ for details=== )</td>

Main sequence turn-off stars\nin the vicinity of the EBS are identified from SDSS photometry; we use the\nproper motions and, where applicable, spectroscopic measurements of these stars\nto probe the kinematics of this apparent stream. We find that the EBS and Hydra\nI share common kinematic and chemical properties with the nearby Monoceros\nRing. In particular, the proper motions of the EBS, like Monoceros, are\nindicative of prograde rotation (V_phi ~ 180-220 km/s), which is similar to the\nGalactic thick disc. The kinematic structure of stars in the vicinity of the\nEBS suggest that it is not a distinct stellar stream, but rather marks the\n"edge" of the Monoceros Ring. The EBS and Hydra I are the latest substructures\nto be linked with Monoceros, leaving the Galactic anti-centre a mess of\ninterlinked overdensities which likely share a unified, Galactic disc origin.</td>

      <td>A method to calculate the local density distribution of the Galaxy from the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution data</td>
      <td>New and more reliable distances and proper motions of a large number of stars\nin the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) catalogue allow to calculate the\nlocal matter density distribution more precisely than earlier. We devised a\nmethod to calculate the stationary gravitational potential distribution\nperpendicular to the Galactic plane by comparing the vertical probability\ndensity distribution of a sample of observed stars with the theoretical\nprobability density distribution computed from their vertical coordinates and\nvelocities. We applied the model to idealised test stars and to the real\nobservational samples. Tests with two mock datasets proved that the method is\nviable and provides reasonable results. Applying the method to TGAS data we\nderived that the total matter density in the Solar neighbourhood is $0.09\pm\n0.02 \text{M}_\odot\text{pc}^{-3}$ being consistent with the results from\nliterature. The matter surface density within $|z|\le 0.75 \text{kpc}$ is\n$42\pm 4 \text{M}_\odot\text{pc}^{-2}$. This is slightly less than the results\nderived by other authors but within errors is consistent with previous\nestimates. Our results show no firm evidence for significant amount of dark\nmatter in the Solar neighbourhood. However, we caution that our calculations at\n$|z| \leq 0.75$ kpc rely on an extrapolation from the velocity distribution\nfunction calculated at $|z| \leq 25$ pc. This extrapolation can be very\nsensitive to our assumption that the stellar motions are perfectly decoupled in\nR and z, and to our assumption of equilibrium. Indeed, we find that $\rho (z)$\nwithin $|z|\le 0.75$ kpc is asymmetric with respect to the Galactic plane at\ndistances $|z| = 0.1-0.4$ kpc indicating that the density distribution may be\ninfluenced by density perturbations.</td>

These may\nretain important clues of the formation and dynamical history of the Milky Way.\nHowever, the nature and origin of many of the streams and structures is\nunclear, hindering our understanding of how the Milky Way formed and evolved.\nWe aim to study the velocity distribution of stars of the Solar neighbourhood\nand investigate the properties of individual kinematic structures in order to\nimprove our understanding of their origins.\n  Using the astrometric data provided by Gaia DR1/TGAS and radial velocities\nfrom RAVE DR5 we perform a wavelet analysis with the `a trous algorithm to\n55831 stars that have U and V velocity uncertainties less than 4 km/s. An\nauto-convolution histogram method is used to filter the output data, and we\nthen run Monte Carlo simulations to verify that the detected structures are\nreal due to velocity uncertainties. Additionally we analysed our stellar sample\nby splitting all stars into a nearby sample (<300 pc) and a distant sample\n(>300 pc), and two chemically defined samples that to a first degree represent\nthe thin and the thick disks.\n  With the much enlarged stellar sample and much increased precision in\ndistances, proper motions, provided by Gaia DR1 TGAS we have shown that the\nvelocity distribution of stars in the Solar neighbourhood contains more\nstructures than previously known. A new feature is discovered and three\nrecently detected groups are confirmed at high confidence level. Dividing the\nsample based on distance and/or metallicity shows that there are variety of\nstructures which are as large-scale and small-scale groups, some of them have\nclear trends on metallicities, others are a mixture of both disk stars and\nbased on that we discuss possible origin of each group.</td>

      <td>Detailed chemical abundance analysis of the thick disk star cluster Gaia 1</td>
      <td>Star clusters, particularly those objects in the disk-bulge-halo interface\nare as of yet poorly charted, albeit carrying important information about the\nformation and the structure of the Milky Way. Here, we present a detailed\nchemical abundance study of the recently discovered object Gaia 1. Photometry\nhas previously suggested it as an intermediate-age, moderately metal-rich\nsystem, although the exact values for its age and metallicity remained\nambiguous in the literature. We measured detailed chemical abundances of 14\nelements in four red giant members, from high-resolution (R=25000) spectra that\nfirmly establish Gaia 1 as an object associated with the thick disk. The\nresulting mean Fe abundance is $-0.62\pm$0.03(stat.)$\pm$0.10(sys.) dex, which\nis more metal-poor than indicated by previous spectroscopy from the literature,\nbut it is fully in line with values from isochrone fitting. We find that Gaia 1\nis moderately enhanced in the $\alpha$-elements, which allowed us to\nconsolidate its membership with the thick disk via chemical tagging. The\ncluster's Fe-peak and neutron-capture elements are similar to those found\nacross the metal-rich disks, where the latter indicate some level of\n$s$-process activity. No significant spread in iron nor in other heavy elements\nwas detected, whereas we find evidence of light-element variations in Na, Mg,\nand Al. Nonetheless, the traditional Na-O and Mg-Al (anti-)correlations,\ntypically seen in old globular clusters, are not seen in our data. This\nconfirms that Gaia 1 is rather a massive and luminous open cluster than a\nlow-mass globular cluster. Finally, orbital computations of the target stars\nbolster our chemical findings of Gaia 1's present-day membership with the thick\ndisk, even though it remains unclear, which mechanisms put it in that place.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Matching Chemo-Dynamical Simulations to Observations of the Milky Way</td>
      <td>The typical methodology for comparing simulated galaxies with observational\nsurveys is usually to apply a spatial selection to the simulation to mimic the\nregion of interest covered by a comparable observational survey sample. In this\nwork we compare this approach with a more sophisticated post-processing in\nwhich the observational uncertainties and selection effects (photometric,\nsurface gravity and effective temperature) are taken into account. We compare a\n`solar neighbourhood analogue' region in a model Milky Way-like galaxy\nsimulated with RAMSES-CH with fourth release Gaia-ESO survey data. We find that\na simple spatial cut alone is insufficient and that observational uncertainties\nmust be accounted for in the comparison. This is particularly true when the\nscale of uncertainty is large compared to the dynamic range of the data, e.g.\nin our comparison, the [Mg/Fe] distribution is affected much more than the more\naccurately determined [Fe/H] distribution. Despite clear differences in the\nunderlying distributions of elemental abundances between simulation and\nobservation, incorporating scatter to our simulation results to mimic\nobservational uncertainty produces reasonable agreement. The quite complete\nnature of the Gaia-ESO survey means that the selection function has minimal\nimpact on the distribution of observed age and metal abundances but this would\nbecome increasingly more important for surveys with narrower selection\nfunctions.</td>

      <td>Assessing distances and consistency of kinematics in Gaia/TGAS</td>
      <td>We apply the statistical methods by Schoenrich, Binney & Asplund to assess\nthe quality of distances and kinematics in the RAVE-TGAS and LAMOST-TGAS\nsamples of Solar neighbourhood stars. These methods yield a nominal distance\naccuracy of 1-2%. Other than common tests on parallax accuracy, they directly\ntest distance estimations including the effects of distance priors. We show how\nto construct these priors including the survey selection functions (SSFs)\ndirectly from the data. We demonstrate that neglecting the SSFs causes severe\ndistance biases. Due to the decline of the SSFs in distance, the simple\n1/parallax estimate only mildly underestimates distances. We test the accuracy\nof measured line-of-sight velocities (v_los) by binning the samples in the\nnominal v_los uncertainties. We find: a) the LAMOST v_los have a ~ -5 km/s\noffset; b) the average LAMOST measurement error for v_los is ~7 km/s,\nsignificantly smaller than, and nearly uncorrelated with the nominal LAMOST\nestimates. The RAVE sample shows either a moderate distance underestimate, or\nan unaccounted source of v_los dispersion (e_v) from measurement errors and\nbinary stars. For a subsample of suspected binary stars in RAVE, our methods\nindicate significant distance underestimates. Separating a sample in\nmetallicity or kinematics to select thick-disc/halo stars, discriminates\nbetween distance bias and e_v. For LAMOST, this separation yields consistency\nwith pure v_los measurement errors. We find an anomaly near longitude\nl~(300+/-60)deg and distance s~(0.32+/-0.03)kpc on both sides of the galactic\nplane, which could be explained by either a localised distance error or a\nbreathing mode.</td>

The models\ndiffer by their disc-to-halo mass ratios, and hence by their susceptibility to\nthe formation of a bar and spiral structure. Seeded from shot noise in the\nparticle distribution, bending waves rapidly form in both models and persist\nfor many billions of years. Waves at intermediate radii manifest as corrugated\nstructures in vertical position and velocity that are tightly wound,\nmorphologically leading, and dominated by the $m=1$ azimuthal Fourier\ncomponent. A spectral analysis of the waves suggests they are a superposition\nof modes from two continuous branches in the Galactocentric radius-rotational\nfrequency plane. The lower-frequency branch is dominant and is responsible for\nthe corrugated, leading, and warped structure. Over time, power in this branch\nmigrates outward, lending credence to an inside-out formation scenario for the\nwarp. Our power spectra qualitatively agree with results from linear\nperturbation theory and a WKB analysis, both of which include self-gravity.\nThus, we conclude that the waves in our simulations are self-gravitating and\nnot purely kinematic. These waves are reminiscent of the wave-like pattern\nrecently found in Galactic star counts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and\nsmoothly transition to a warp near the disc's edge. Velocity measurements from\n\textit{Gaia} data will be instrumental in testing the true wave nature of the\ncorrugations.

Within the\npanoply of methods used for data exploration, visualisation is often the\nstarting point and even the guiding reference for scientific thought. However,\nthis is a volume of data that cannot be efficiently explored using traditional\ntools, techniques, and habits.\n  Aims: We aim to provide a global visual exploration service for the Gaia\narchive, something that is not possible out of the box for most people. The\nservice has two main goals. The first is to provide a software platform for\ninteractive visual exploration of the archive contents, using common personal\ncomputers and mobile devices available to most users. The second aim is to\nproduce intelligible and appealing visual representations of the enormous\ninformation content of the archive.\n  Methods: The interactive exploration service follows a client-server design.\nThe server runs close to the data, at the archive, and is responsible for\nhiding as far as possible the complexity and volume of the Gaia data from the\nclient. This is achieved by serving visual detail on demand. Levels of detail\nare pre-computed using data aggregation and subsampling techniques. For DR1,\nthe client is a web application that provides an interactive multi-panel\nvisualisation workspace as well as a graphical user interface.\n  Results: The Gaia archive Visualisation Service offers a web-based\nmulti-panel interactive visualisation desktop in a browser tab. It currently\nprovides highly configurable 1D histograms and 2D scatter plots of Gaia DR1 and\nthe Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) with linked views.

We use common fields between the\nspectroscopic surveys of APOGEE, LAMOST, RAVE (ALR) and APOGEE, RAVE, Gaia-ESO\n(AGR) and use two stellar population synthesis models, GALAXIA and TRILEGAL, to\ncreate mock fields for each survey. We apply the selection function in the form\nof colour and magnitude cuts of the respective survey to the mock fields to\nreplicate the observed source sample. We make a basic comparison between the\nmodels to check which best reproduces the observed sample distribution. We\ncarry out a quantitative comparison between the synthetic MDF from the mock\ncatalogues using both models to understand the effect of the selection function\non the MDF and on the vertical metallicity gradient. Using both models, we find\na negligible effect of the selection function on the MDF for APOGEE, LAMOST,\nand RAVE. We find a negligible selection function effect on the vertical\nmetallicity gradients as well, though GALAXIA and TRILEGAL have steeper and\nshallower slopes, respectively, than the observed gradient. After applying\ncorrection terms on the metallicities of RAVE and LAMOST with respect to our\nreference APOGEE sample, our observed vertical metallicity gradients between\nthe four surveys are consistent within 1-sigma. We also find consistent\ngradient for the combined sample of all surveys in ALR and AGR. We estimated a\nmean vertical metallicity gradient of -0.241+/-0.028 dex kpc-1. There is a\nsignificant scatter in the estimated gradients in the literature, but our\nestimates are within their ranges.</td>

      <td>We confirm the reality of the recently discovered Milky Way stellar cluster\n$\textit{Gaia}$ 1 using spectra acquired with the HERMES and AAOmega\nspectrographs of the Anglo-Australian Telescope. This cluster had been\npreviously undiscovered due to its close angular proximity to Sirius, the\nbrightest star in the sky at visual wavelengths. Our observations identified 41\ncluster members, and yielded an overall metallicity of [Fe/H]$=-0.13\pm0.13$\nand barycentric radial velocity of $v_r=58.30\pm0.22$ km/s. These kinematics\nprovide a dynamical mass estimate of $12.9^{+4.6}_{-3.9}\times10^3$\nM$_{\odot}$. Isochrone fits to $\textit{Gaia}$, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS1\nphotometry indicate that $\textit{Gaia}$ 1 is an intermediate age ($\sim3$ Gyr)\nstellar cluster. Combining the spatial and kinematic data we calculate\n$\textit{Gaia}$ 1 has a circular orbit with a radius of about 12~kpc, but with\na large out of plane motion: $z_\textrm{max}=1.1^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ kpc. Clusters\nwith such orbits are unlikely to survive long due to the number of plane\npassages they would experience.</td>

      <td>The present-day response of a Galactic disc stellar population to a\nnon-axisymmetric perturbation of the potential has previously been computed\nthrough perturbation theory within the phase-space coordinates of the\nunperturbed axisymmetric system. Such an Eulerian linearized treatment however\nleads to singularities at resonances, which prevent quantitative comparisons\nwith data. Here, we manage to capture the behaviour of the distribution\nfunction (DF) at a resonance in a Lagrangian approach, by averaging the\nHamiltonian over fast angle variables and re-expressing the DF in terms of a\nnew set of canonical actions and angles variables valid in the resonant region.\nWe then follow the prescription of Binney (2016), assigning to the resonant DF\nthe time average along the orbits of the axisymmetric DF expressed in the new\nset of actions and angles. This boils down to phase-mixing the DF in terms of\nthe new angles, such that the DF for trapped orbits only depends on the new set\nof actions. This opens the way to quantitatively fitting the effects of the bar\nand spirals to Gaia data in terms of distribution functions in action space.</td>

      <td>Stellar Inventory of the Solar Neighborhood using Gaia DR1</td>
      <td>The absolute number and the density profiles of different types of stars in\nthe solar neighborhood are a fundamental anchor for studies of the initial mass\nfunction, stellar evolution, and galactic structure. Using data from the Gaia\nDR1 Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution, we reconstruct Gaia's selection function\nand we determine Gaia's volume completeness, the local number density, and the\nvertical profiles of different spectral types along the main sequence from\nearly A stars to late K stars as well as along the giant branch. We clearly\ndetect the expected flattening of the stellar density profile near the\nmid-plane for all stellar types: All vertical profiles are well represented by\nsech^2 profiles, with scale heights ranging from ~50 pc for A stars to ~150 pc\nfor G and K dwarfs and giants. We determine the luminosity function along the\nmain sequence for M_V < 7 (M >~ $0.72 M_\odot$) and along the giant branch for\nM_J >~ -2.5. Converting this to a mass function, we find that the high-mass (M\n> $1\,M_\odot$) present-day mass function along the main sequence is d n / d M\n= 0.016 $(M/M_\odot)^{-4.7}$ stars/pc^3/$M_\odot$. Extrapolating below M =\n$0.72\,M_\odot$, we find a total mid-plane stellar density of 0.040+/-0.002\n$M_\odot$/pc^3. Giants contribute 0.00039+/-0.00001 stars/pc^3 or about\n0.00046+/-0.00005 $M_\odot$/pc^3. The star-formation rate surface density is\n\Sigma(t) = 7+/-1 exp(-t/[7+/-1 Gyr]) $M_\odot$/pc^2/Gyr. Overall, we find that\nGaia DR1's selection biases are manageable and allow a detailed new inventory\nof the solar neighborhood to be made that agrees with and extends previous\nstudies. This bodes well for mapping the Milky Way with the full Gaia data set.</td>

The sample\nconsisting of BL Herculis and W Virginis subtypes is used to derive\nperiod-luminosity relations after correcting mean-magnitudes for the\nextinction. Our $K_s$-band period-luminosity relation, $K_s =\n-2.189(0.056)~[\log(P) - 1] + 11.187(0.032)$, is consistent with published work\nfor BL Herculis and W Virginis variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We\npresent a combined OGLE-III and VVV catalogue with periods, classification,\nmean magnitudes and extinction for 264 Galactic bulge population II Cepheids\nhaving good-quality $K_s$-band light curves. The absolute magnitudes for\npopulation II Cepheids and RR Lyraes calibrated using Gaia and Hubble Space\nTelescope parallaxes, together with calibrated magnitudes for Large Magellanic\nCloud population II Cepheids, are used to obtain a distance to the Galactic\ncenter, $R_0=8.34\pm0.03{\mathrm{(stat.)}}\pm0.41{\mathrm{(syst.)}}$, which\nchanges by $^{+ 0.05}_{-0.25}$ with different extinction laws. While noting the\nlimitation of small number statistics, we find that the present sample of\npopulation II Cepheids in the Galactic bulge shows a nearly spheroidal spatial\ndistribution, similar to metal-poor RR Lyrae variables. We do not find evidence\nof the inclined bar as traced by the metal-rich red-clump stars. The number\ndensity for population II Cepheids is more limited as compared to abundant RR\nLyraes but they are bright and exhibit a wide range in period that provides a\nrobust period-luminosity relation for an accurate estimate of the distance to\nthe Galactic center.</td>

The stellar over-density in the Anti-centre\nregion can be split into two components, the narrow, stream-like ACS and the\nsmooth Ring. According to our analysis, these two structures show very similar\nbut clearly distinct kinematic trends, which can be summarised as follows: the\namplitude of the velocity variation in $v_{\phi}$ and $v_z$ in the ACS is\nhigher compared to the Ring, whose velocity gradients appear to be flatter.\nCurrently, no model available can explain the entirety of the data in this area\nof the sky.

We first identify galaxies with mass\ncomparable to the MW ($9 \times 10^{11} \le M_{200} \le 1.2 \times 10^{12}\n\Msun $) and consider the tilting rates between $z=0.3$ and $0$.

We show that our sample of galaxies\ncovers a wide range of environments, including some similar to the MW's. We\nfind galaxies in denser regions tilt with higher rates then galaxies in less\ndense regions. We also find correlations between the angular misalignment of\nthe hot gas corona, and the tilting rate. {\it Gaia} is likely to be able to\ndirectly measure tilting in the MW. Such a detection will provide an important\nconstraint on the environment of the MW, including the rate of gas cooling onto\nthe disc, the shape and orientation of its dark matter halo, and the mass of\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud.

      <td>Migration and kinematics in growing disc galaxies with thin and thick discs</td>
      <td>We analyse disc heating and radial migration in N-body models of growing disc\ngalaxies with thick and thin discs. Similar to thin-disc-only models, galaxies\nwith appropriate non-axisymmetric structures reproduce observational\nconstraints on radial disc heating in and migration to the Solar Neighbourhood\n(Snhd). The presence of thick discs can suppress non-axisymmetries and thus\nhigher baryonic-to-dark matter fractions are required than in models that only\nhave a thin disc. Models that are baryon-dominated to roughly the Solar radius\nR_0 are favoured, in agreement with data for the Milky Way. For inside-out\ngrowing discs, today's thick-disc stars at R_0 are dominated by outwards\nmigrators. Whether outwards migrators are vertically hotter than non-migrators\ndepends on the radial gradient of the thick disc vertical velocity dispersion.\nThere is an effective upper boundary in angular momentum that thick disc stars\nborn in the centre of a galaxy can reach by migration, which explains the\nfading of the high-alpha sequence outside R_0. Our models compare well to Snhd\nkinematics from RAVE-TGAS. For such comparisons it is important to take into\naccount the azimuthal variation of kinematics at R ~ R_0 and biases from survey\nselection functions. The vertical heating of thin disc stars by giant molecular\nclouds is only mildly affected by the presence of thick discs. Our models\npredict higher vertical velocity dispersions for the oldest stars than found in\nthe Snhd age-velocity dispersion relation, possibly because of measurement\nuncertainties or an underestimation of the number of old cold stars in our\nmodels.</td>

      <td>We attempt to constrain the kinematics of the thin and thick disks using the\nBesancon population synthesis model together with RAVE DR4 and Gaia first data\nrelease (TGAS). The RAVE fields were simulated by applying a detailed target\nselection function and the kinematics was computed using velocity ellipsoids\ndepending on age in order to study the secular evolution. We accounted for the\nasymmetric drift computed from fitting a Stackel potential to orbits. Model\nparameters such as velocity dispersions, mean motions, and velocity gradients\nwere adjusted using an ABC-MCMC method. We made use of the metallicity to\nenhance the separation between thin and thick disks. We show that this model is\nable to reproduce the kinematics of the local disks in great detail. The disk\nfollows the expected secular evolution, in very good agreement with previous\nstudies of the thin disk. The new asymmetric drift formula, fitted to our\npreviously described St\"ackel potential, fairly well reproduces the velocity\ndistribution in a wide solar neighborhood. The U and W components of the solar\nmotion determined with this method agree well with previous studies. However,\nwe find a smaller V component than previously thought, essentially because we\ninclude the variation of the asymmetric drift with distance to the plane. The\nthick disk is represented by a long period of formation (at least 2 Gyr),\nduring which, as we show, the mean velocity increases with time while the scale\nheight and scale length decrease, very consistently with a collapse phase with\nconservation of angular momentum. This new Galactic dynamical model is able to\nreproduce the observed velocities in a wide solar neighborhood at the quality\nlevel of the TGAS-RAVE sample, allowing us to constrain the thin and thick disk\ndynamical evolution, as well as determining the solar motion.</td>

      <td>Reliability of the measured velocity anisotropy of the Milky Way stellar halo</td>
      <td>Determining the velocity distribution of halo stars is essential for\nestimating the mass of the Milky Way and for inferring its formation history.\nSince the stellar halo is a dynamically hot system, the velocity distribution\nof halo stars is well described by the 3-dimensional velocity dispersions\n$(\sigma_r, \sigma_\theta, \sigma_\phi)$, or by the velocity anisotropy\nparameter $\beta=1-(\sigma_\theta^2+\sigma_\phi^2)/(2\sigma_r^2)$. Direct\nmeasurements of $(\sigma_r, \sigma_\theta, \sigma_\phi)$ consistently suggest\n$\beta =0.5$-$0.7$ for nearby halo stars. In contrast, the value of $\beta$ at\nlarge Galactocentric radius $r$ is still controversial, since reliable proper\nmotion data are available for only a handful of stars. In the last decade,\nseveral authors have tried to estimate $\beta$ for distant halo stars by\nfitting the observed line-of-sight velocities at each radius with simple\nvelocity distribution models (local fitting methods). Some results of local\nfitting methods imply $\beta<0$ at $r \gtrsim 20 \;\rm{kpc}$, which is\ninconsistent with recent predictions from cosmological simulations. Here we\nperform mock-catalogue analyses to show that the estimates of $\beta$ based on\nlocal fitting methods are reliable only at $r \leq 15 \;\rm{kpc}$ with the\ncurrent sample size ($\sim10^3$ stars at a given radius). As $r$ increases, the\nline-of-sight velocity (corrected for the Solar reflex motion) becomes\nincreasingly closer to the Galactocentric radial velocity, so that it becomes\nincreasingly more difficult to estimate tangential velocity dispersion\n$(\sigma_\theta, \sigma_\phi)$ from line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our\nresults suggest that the forthcoming Gaia data will be crucial for\nunderstanding the velocity distribution of halo stars at $r \geq 20\;\rm{kpc}$.</td>

      <td>The properties of energetically unbound stars in stellar clusters</td>
      <td>Several Milky Way star clusters show a roughly flat velocity dispersion\nprofile at large radii, which is not expected from models with a tidal cut-off\nenergy. Possible explanations for this excess velocity include: the effects of\na dark matter halo, modified gravity theories and energetically unbound stars\ninside of clusters. These stars are known as potential escapers (PEs) and can\nexist indefinitely within clusters which are on circular orbits. Through a\nseries of N-body simulations of star cluster systems, where we vary the\ngalactic potential, orbital eccentricity and stellar mass function, we\ninvestigate the properties of the PEs and their effects on the kinematics. We\nderive a prediction for the scaling of the velocity dispersion at the Jacobi\nsurface due to PEs, as a function of cluster mass, angular velocity of the\ncluster orbit, and slope of the mass profile of the host galaxy. We see a\ntentative signal of the mass and orbital velocity dependence in kinematic data\nof globular clusters from literature. We also find that the fraction of PEs\ndepends sensitively on the galactic mass profile, reaching as high as 40% in\nthe cusp of a Navarro-Frenk-White profile and as the velocity anisotropy also\ndepends on the slope of the galactic mass profile, we conclude that PEs provide\nan independent way of inferring the properties of the dark matter mass profile\nat the galactic radius of (globular) clusters in the Gaia era.</td>

      <td>We present a novel analysis of the metal-poor star sample in the complete\nRadial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Data Release 5 catalog with the goal of\nidentifying and characterizing all very metal-poor stars observed by the\nsurvey. Using a three-stage method, we first identified the candidate stars\nusing only their spectra as input information. We employed an algorithm called\nt-SNE to construct a low-dimensional projection of the spectrum space and\nisolate the region containing metal-poor stars. Following this step, we\nmeasured the equivalent widths of the near-infrared CaII triplet lines with a\nmethod based on flexible Gaussian processes to model the correlated noise\npresent in the spectra. In the last step, we constructed a calibration relation\nthat converts the measured equivalent widths and the color information coming\nfrom the 2MASS and WISE surveys into metallicity and temperature estimates. We\nidentified 877 stars with at least a 50% probability of being very metal-poor\n$(\rm [Fe/H] < -2\,\rm dex)$, out of which 43 are likely extremely metal-poor\n$(\rm [Fe/H] < -3\,\rm dex )$. The comparison of the derived values to a small\nsubsample of stars with literature metallicity values shows that our method\nworks reliably and correctly estimates the uncertainties, which typically have\nvalues $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} \approx 0.2\,\mathrm{dex}$. In addition, when\ncompared to the metallicity results derived using the RAVE DR5 pipeline, it is\nevident that we achieve better accuracy than the pipeline and therefore more\nreliably evaluate the very metal-poor subsample. Based on the repeated\nobservations of the same stars, our method gives very consistent results. The\nmethod used in this work can also easily be extended to other large-scale data\nsets, including to the data from the Gaia mission and the upcoming 4MOST\nsurvey.</td>

We have\nadapted a made-to-measure dynamical model tailored for the Milky Way to\ninvestigate the kinematics of the solar neighborhood (SNd). The model matches\nthe 3D density of the red clump giant stars (RCGs) in the bulge and bar as well\nas stellar kinematics in the inner Galaxy, with a pattern speed of 39 km\ns$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. Cross-matching this model with the $Gaia$ DR1 TGAS data\ncombined with RAVE and LAMOST radial velocities, we find that the model\nnaturally predicts a bimodality in the $U\!-\!V$-velocity distribution for\nnearby stars which is in good agreement with the Hercules stream. In the model,\nthe Hercules stream is made of stars orbiting the Lagrange points of the bar\nwhich move outward from the bar's corotation radius to visit the SNd. While the\nmodel is not yet a quantitative fit of the velocity distribution, the new\npicture naturally predicts that the Hercules stream is more prominent inward\nfrom the Sun and nearly absent only a few $100$ pc outward of the Sun, and\nplausibly explains that Hercules is prominent in old and metal-rich stars.</td>

These\nstars are in general more metal-poor than the disk, but surprisingly, half of\nour halo sample is comprised of stars with [Fe/H]>-1.

We find similar properties in the Latte cosmological\nzoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy from the FIRE project. In Latte,\nmetal-rich halo stars formed primarily inside of the solar circle, while\nlower-metallicity halo stars preferentially formed at larger distances\n(extending beyond the virial radius). This suggests that metal-rich halo stars\nin the Solar neighborhood in fact formed in-situ within the Galactic disk\nrather than having been accreted from satellite systems.

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Exploring the complex nature and origins of the Galactic bulge populations</td>
      <td>Abridged: We used the fourth internal data release of the Gaia-ESO survey to\ncharacterize the bulge chemistry, spatial distribution, kinematics, and to\ncompare it chemically with the thin and thick disks. The sample consist on\n~2500 red clump stars in 11 bulge fields ($-10^\circ\leq l\leq+8^\circ$ and\n$-10^\circ\leq b\leq-4^\circ$), and a set of ~6300 disk stars selected for\ncomparison. The bulge MDF is confirmed to be bimodal across the whole sampled\narea, with metal-poor stars dominating at high latitudes. The metal-rich stars\nexhibit bar-like kinematics and display a bimodality in their magnitude\ndistribution, a feature which is tightly associated with the X-shape bulge.\nThey overlap with the metal-rich end of the thin disk sequence in the [Mg/Fe]\nvs. [Fe/H] plane. Metal-poor bulge stars have a more isotropic hot kinematics\nand do not participate in the X-shape bulge. With similar Mg-enhancement\nlevels, the position of the metal-poor bulge sequence "knee" is observed at\n[Fe/H]$_{knee}=-0.37\pm0.09$, being 0.06 dex higher than that of the thick\ndisk. It suggests a higher SFR for the bulge than for the thick disk. Finally,\nwe present a chemical evolution model that suitably fits the whole bulge\nsequence by assuming a fast ($<1$ Gyr) intense burst of stellar formation at\nearly epochs. We associate metal-rich stars with the B/P bulge formed from the\nsecular evolution of the early thin disk. On the other hand, the metal-poor\nsubpopulation might be the product of an early prompt dissipative collapse\ndominated by massive stars. Nevertheless, our results do not allow us to firmly\nrule out the possibility that these stars come from the secular evolution of\nthe early thick disk. This is the first time that an analysis of the bulge MDF\nand $\alpha$-abundances has been performed in a large area on the basis of a\nhomogeneous, fully spectroscopic analysis of high-resolution, high S/N data.</td>

Comparable\nobservations in stars are more difficult and, until recently, plagued by small\nnumber statistics.

By using the UVES spectra of the GES sample, we\nare able to assemble a sample of 1301 Galactic stars, including stars in open\nand globular clusters in which both sulfur and zinc were measured. We confirm\nthe results from the literature that sulfur behaves as an alpha-element. We\nfind a large scatter in [Zn/Fe] ratios among giant stars around solar\nmetallicity. The lower ratios are observed in giant stars at Galactocentric\ndistances less than 7.5 kpc. No such effect is observed among dwarf stars,\nsince they do not extend to that radius. Given the sample selection, giants and\ndwarfs are observed at different Galactic locations, and it is plausible, and\ncompatible with simple calculations, that Zn-poor giants trace a younger\npopulation more polluted by SN Ia yields. It is necessary to extend\nobservations in order to observe both giants and dwarfs at the same Galactic\nlocation. Further theoretical work on the evolution of zinc is also necessary.</td>

The adopted\nchemo-dynamical model, with the new generation of metallicity-dependent stellar\nyields for massive stars, is able to reproduce the observed spatial\ndistributions of abundance ratios, in particular the abundance ratios of [O/Fe]\nand [Mg/Fe] in the inner disc (5 kpc<RGC <7 kpc), with their differences, that\nwere usually poorly explained by chemical evolution models. Often, oxygen and\nmagnesium are considered as equivalent in tracing alpha-element abundances and\nin deducing, e.g., the formation time-scales of different Galactic stellar\npopulations. In addition, often [alpha/Fe] is computed combining several\nalpha-elements. Our results indicate, as expected, a complex and diverse\nnucleosynthesis of the various alpha-elements, in particular in the high\nmetallicity regimes, pointing towards a different origin of these elements and\nhighlighting the risk of considering them as a single class with common\nfeatures.</td>

      <td>Hot Stuff for One Year (HSOY) - A 583 million star proper motion catalogue derived from Gaia DR1 and PPMXL</td>
      <td>Recently, the first installment of data from ESA's Gaia astrometric satellite\nmission (Gaia-DR1) was released, containing positions of more than 1 billion\nstars with unprecedented precision, as well as only proper motions and\nparallaxes, however only for a subset of 2 million objects. The second release,\ndue in late 2017 or early 2018, will include those quantities for most objects.\nIn order to provide a dataset that bridges the time gap between the Gaia-DR1\nand Gaia-DR2 releases and partly remedies the lack of proper motions in the\nformer, HSOY ("Hot Stuff for One Year") was created as a hybrid catalogue\nbetween Gaia-DR1 and ground-based astrometry, featuring proper motions (but no\nparallaxes) for a large fraction of the DR1 objects. While not attempting to\ncompete with future Gaia releases in terms of data quality or number of\nobjects, the aim of HSOY is to provide improved proper motions partly based on\nGaia data, allowing some studies to be carried out just now or as pilot studies\nfor later larger projects requiring higher-precision data. The HSOY catalogue\nwas compiled using the positions taken from Gaia-DR1 combined with the input\ndata from the PPMXL catalogue, employing the same weighted least-squares\ntechnique that was used to assemble the PPMXL catalogue itself. Results. This\neffort resulted in a four-parameter astrometric catalogue containing\n583,000,000 objects, with Gaia-DR1 quality positions and proper motions with\nprecisions from significantly less than 1 mas/yr to 5 mas/yr, depending on the\nobject's brightness and location on the sky.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey. Mg-Al anti-correlation in iDR4 globular clusters</td>
      <td>We use Gaia-ESO Survey iDR4 data to explore the Mg-Al anti-correlation in\nglobular clusters, that were observed as calibrators, as a demonstration of the\nquality of Gaia-ESO Survey data and analysis. The results compare well with the\navailable literature, within 0.1 dex or less, after a small (compared to the\ninternal spreads) offset between the UVES and the GIRAFFE data of 0.10-0.15 dex\nwas taken into account. In particular, we present for the first time data for\nNGC 5927, one of the most metal-rich globular clusters studied in the\nliterature so far with [Fe/H]=-0.49 dex, that was included to connect with the\nopen cluster regime in the Gaia-ESO Survey internal calibration. The extent and\nshape of the Mg-Al anti-correlation provide strong constraints on the multiple\npopulation phenomenon in globular clusters. In particular, we studied the\ndependency of the Mg-Al anti-correlation extension with metallicity,\npresent-day mass, and age of the clusters, using GES data in combination with a\nlarge set of homogenized literature measurements. We find a dependency with\nboth metallicity and mass, that is evident when fitting for the two parameters\nsimultaneously, but no significant dependency with age. We confirm that the\nMg-Al anti-correlation is not seen in all clusters, but disappears for the less\nmassive or most metal-rich ones. We also use our dataset to see whether a\nnormal anti-correlation would explain the low [Mg/$\alpha$] observed in some\nextragalactic globular clusters, but find that none of the clusters in our\nsample can reproduce it, and more extreme chemical compositions (like the one\nof NGC 2419) would be required. We conclude that GES iDR4 data already meet the\nrequirements set by the main survey goals, and can be used to study in detail\nglobular clusters even if the analysis procedures were not specifically\ndesigned for them.</td>

      <td>The kinematic signature of the Galactic warp in Gaia DR1 - I. The Hipparcos subsample</td>
      <td>The mechanism responsible for the warp of our Galaxy, as well as its\ndynamical nature, continues to remain unknown. With the advent of high\nprecision astrometry, new horizons have been opened for detecting the\nkinematics associated with the warp and constraining possible warp formation\nscenarios for the Milky Way. The aim of this contribution is to establish\nwhether the first Gaia data release (DR1) shows significant evidence of the\nkinematic signature expected from a long-lived Galactic warp in the kinematics\nof distant OB stars. As the first paper in a series, we present our approach\nfor analyzing the proper motions and apply it to the sub-sample of Hipparcos\nstars. We select a sample of 989 distant spectroscopically-identified OB stars\nfrom the New Reduction of Hipparcos, of which 758 are also in Gaia DR1,\ncovering distances from 0.5 to 3 kpc from the Sun. We develop a model of the\nspatial distribution and kinematics of the OB stars from which we produce the\nprobability distribution functions of the proper motions, with and without the\nsystematic motions expected from a long-lived warp. A likelihood analysis is\nused to compare the expectations of the models with the observed proper motions\nfrom both Hipparcos and Gaia DR1. We find that the proper motions of the nearby\nOB stars are consistent with the signature of a warp, while those of the more\ndistant stars (parallax<1 mas) are not. The kinematics of our sample of young\nOB stars suggests that systematic vertical motions in the disk cannot be\nexplained by a simple model of a stable long-lived warp. The Galactic warp may\neither be a transient feature, or additional phenomena are acting on the\ngaseous component of the Milky Way, causing systematic vertical motions that\nare masking the expected warp signal. A larger and deeper sample of stars with\nGaia astrometry will be needed to constrain the dynamical nature of the\nGalactic warp.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: the present-day radial metallicity distribution of the Galactic disc probed by pre-main-sequence clusters</td>
      <td>The radial metallicity distribution in the Galactic thin disc represents a\ncrucial constraint for modelling disc formation and evolution. Open clusters\nallow us to derive both the radial metallicity distribution and its evolution\nover time. In this paper we perform the first investigation of the present-day\nradial metallicity distribution based on [Fe/H] determinations in late type\nmembers of pre-main-sequence clusters. Because of their youth, these clusters\nare therefore essential for tracing the current inter-stellar medium\nmetallicity. We used the products of the Gaia-ESO Survey analysis of 12 young\nregions (age<100 Myr), covering Galactocentric distances from 6.67 to 8.70 kpc.\nFor the first time, we derived the metal content of star forming regions\nfarther than 500 pc from the Sun. Median metallicities were determined through\nsamples of reliable cluster members. For ten clusters the membership analysis\nis discussed in the present paper, while for other two clusters (Chamaeleon I\nand Gamma Velorum) we adopted the members identified in our previous works. All\nthe pre-main-sequence clusters considered in this paper have close-to-solar or\nslightly sub-solar metallicities. The radial metallicity distribution traced by\nthese clusters is almost flat, with the innermost star forming regions having\n[Fe/H] values that are 0.10-0.15 dex lower than the majority of the older\nclusters located at similar Galactocentric radii. This homogeneous study of the\npresent-day radial metallicity distribution in the Galactic thin disc favours\nmodels that predict a flattening of the radial gradient over time. On the other\nhand, the decrease of the average [Fe/H] at young ages is not easily explained\nby the models. Our results reveal a complex interplay of several processes\n(e.g. star formation activity, initial mass function, supernova yields, gas\nflows) that controlled the recent evolution of the Milky Way.</td>

      <td>We constrain the shape of the Milky Way's halo by dynamical modeling of the\nobserved phase-space tracks of the Pal 5 and GD-1 tidal streams. We find that\nthe only information about the potential gleaned from the tracks of these\nstreams are precise measurements of the shape of the gravitational\npotential---the ratio of vertical to radial acceleration---at the location of\nthe streams, with weaker constraints on the radial and vertical accelerations\nseparately. The latter will improve significantly with precise proper-motion\nmeasurements from Gaia. We measure that the overall potential flattening is\n0.95 +/- 0.04 at the location of GD-1 ([R,z] ~ [12.5,6.7] kpc) and 0.94 +/-\n0.05 at the position of Pal 5 ([R,z] ~ [8.4,16.8] kpc). Combined with\nconstraints on the force field near the Galactic disk, we determine that the\naxis ratio of the dark-matter halo's density distribution is 1.05 +/- 0.14\nwithin the inner 20 kpc, with a hint that the halo becomes more flattened near\nthe edge of this volume. The halo mass within 20 kpc is 1.1 +/- 0.1 x 10^{11}\nM_sun.

      <td>Determination of robust metallicities for metal-rich red giant branch stars</td>
      <td>The study of the Milky Way relies on our ability to interpret the light from\nstars correctly. This calls for a reinvestigation of how reliably we can\ndetermine, e.g., iron abundances in such stars and how well they reproduce\nthose of dwarf stars. Here we explore robust ways to determine the iron content\nof metal-rich giant stars. We aim to understand what biases and shortcomings\nwidely applied methods suffer from. In this study we are mainly concerned with\nstandard methods to analyse stellar spectra. This includes the analysis of\nindividual lines to determine stellar parameters, analysis of the broad wings\nof certain lines (e.g., H$\alpha$ and calcium lines) to determine effective\ntemperature and surface gravity for the stars. For NGC 6528 we find that [Fe/H]\n= $+0.04$ dex with a scatter of $\sigma=0.07$ dex, which gives an error in the\nderived mean abundance of 0.02 dex. Our work has two important conclusions for\nanalysis of metal-rich red giant branch stars. 1) For spectra with S/N below\nabout 35 per reduced pixel [Fe/H] become too high, 2) Determination of $T_{\rm\neff}$ using the wings of the H$\alpha$ line results in [Fe/H] values about 0.1\ndex higher than if excitational equilibrium is used. The last conclusion is\nperhaps not surprising as we expect NLTE effect to become more prominent in\ncooler stars and we can not use the the wings of the H$\alpha$ line to\ndetermine $T_{\rm eff}$ for the cool stars in our sample. We therefore\nrecommend that in studies of metal-rich red giant stars care needs to be taken\nto obtain sufficient calibration data in order to be able to also use the\ncooler stars.</td>

As a consequence, the\nwork on the deblending and decontamination pipelines is still ongoing. We\ndescribe the present status of the pipelines for different Gaia instruments,\nand we model the end-of-mission crowding errors on the basis of available\ninformation. We then apply the nominal post-launch Gaia performances,\nappropriately worsened by the estimated crowding errors, to a set of 18\nsimulated globular clusters with different concentration, distance, and field\ncontamination. We conclude that there will be 103-104 stars with astrometric\nperformances virtually untouched by crowding (contaminated by <1 mmag) in the\nmajority of clusters. The most limiting factor will be field crowding, not\ncluster crowding: the most contaminated clusters will only contain 10-100 clean\nstars. We also conclude that: (i) the systemic proper motions and parallaxes\nwill be determined to 1% or better up to 15 kpc, and the nearby clusters will\nhave radial velocities to a few km/s ; (ii) internal kinematics will be of\nunprecendented quality, cluster masses will be determined to 10% up to 15 kpc\nand beyond, and it will be possible to identify differences of a few km/s or\nless in the kinematics (if any) of cluster sub-populations up to 10 kpc and\nbeyond; (iii) the brightest stars (V<17 mag) will have space-quality,\nwide-field photometry (mmag errors), and all Gaia photometry will have 1-3%\nerrors on the absolute photometric calibration.</td>

For the young stars, the probably perturbed velocities similar to the\nold population are mostly removed from the velocity maps in the $X$--$Y$ plane.\nThe residual velocity field shows that the young stars consistently move along\n$Y$ with faster $v_\phi$ at the trailing side of the local arm, while at the\nleading side, they move slower in azimuth direction. At both sides, the young\nstars averagely move inward with $v_R$ of $-5\sim-3$ km s$^{-1}$. The\ndivergence of the velocity in $Y$ direction implies that the young stars are\nassociated with a density wave nearby the local arm. We therefore suggest that\nthe young stars may reflect the formation of the local spiral arm by\ncorrelating themselves with a density wave. The range of the age for the young\nstars is around 2 Gyr, which is sensible since the transient spiral arm can\nsustain that long. We also point out that alternative explanations of the\npeculiar velocity field for the young population cannot be ruled out only from\nthis observed data.</td>

      <td>A box full of chocolates: The rich structure of the nearby stellar halo revealed by Gaia and RAVE</td>
      <td>The hierarchical structure formation model predicts that stellar halos should\nform, at least partly, via mergers. If this was a predominant formation channel\nfor the Milky Way's halo, imprints of this merger history in the form of moving\ngroups or streams should exist also in the vicinity of the Sun. Here we study\nthe kinematics of halo stars in the Solar neighbourhood using the very recent\nfirst data release from the Gaia mission, and in particular the TGAS dataset,\nin combination with data from the RAVE survey. Our aim is to determine the\namount of substructure present in the phase-space distribution of halo stars\nthat could be linked to merger debris. To characterise kinematic substructure,\nwe measure the velocity correlation function in our sample of halo (low\nmetallicity) stars. We also study the distribution of these stars in the space\nof energy and two components of the angular momentum, in what we call\n"Integrals of Motion" space. The velocity correlation function reveals\nsubstructure in the form of an excess of pairs of stars with similar\nvelocities, well above that expected for a smooth distribution. Comparison to\ncosmological simulations of the formation of stellar halos indicate that the\nlevels found are consistent with the Galactic halo having been built fully via\naccretion. Similarly, the distribution of stars in the space of "Integrals of\nmotion" is highly complex. A strikingly high fraction (between 58% and upto\n73%) of the stars that are somewhat less bound than the Sun are on (highly)\nretrograde orbits. A simple comparison to Milky Way-mass galaxies in\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations suggests that less than 1% have such\nprominently retrograde outer halos. We also identify several other\nstatistically significant structures in "Integrals of Motion" space that could\npotentially be related to merger events.</td>

We find these fast Galactic rotators more clearly outside\nof the Solar radius, compared to inside of the Solar radius. In addition, the\nvelocity of the fast Galactic rotators is independent of the Galactocentric\ndistance up to $R-R_{\odot}\sim0.6$ kpc. Comparing with numerical models, we\nqualitatively discuss that a possible cause of this feature is the co-rotation\nresonance of the Perseus spiral arm, where the stars in peri-centre phase in\nthe trailing side of the Perseus spiral arm experience an extended period of\nacceleration owing to the torque from the Perseus arm.</td>

      <td>Tracing the Hercules stream with Gaia and LAMOST: new evidence for a fast bar in the Milky Way</td>
      <td>The length and pattern speed of the Milky Way bar are still controversial.\nPhotometric and spectroscopic surveys of the inner Galaxy, as well as gas\nkinematics, favour a long and slowly rotating bar, with corotation around a\nGalactocentric radius of 6 kpc. On the other hand, the existence of the\nHercules stream in local velocity space favours a short and fast bar with\ncorotation around 4 kpc. This follows from the fact that the Hercules stream\nlooks like a typical signature of the outer Lindblad resonance of the bar. As\nwe showed recently, reconciling this local stream with a slow bar would need to\nfind a yet unknown alternative explanation, based for instance on the effect of\nspiral arms. Here, by combining the TGAS catalogue of the Gaia DR1 with LAMOST\nradial velocities, we show that the position of Hercules in velocity space as a\nfunction of radius in the outer Galaxy indeed varies exactly as predicted by\nfast bar models with a pattern speed no less than 1.8 times the circular\nfrequency at the Sun's position.</td>

      <td>On the kinematic detection of accreted streams in the Gaia era: a cautionary tale</td>
      <td>The $\Lambda$CDM cosmological scenario predicts that our Galaxy should\ncontain hundreds of stellar streams at the solar vicinity, fossil relics of the\nmerging history of the Milky Way and more generally of the hierarchical growth\nof galaxies. Because of the mixing time scales in the inner Galaxy, it has been\nclaimed that these streams should be difficult to detect in configuration space\nbut can still be identifiable in kinematic-related spaces like the\nenergy/angular momenta spaces, E-Lz and Lperp-Lz, or spaces of orbital/velocity\nparameters. By means of high-resolution, dissipationless N-body simulations,\ncontaining between 25$\times10^6$ and 35$\times10^6$ particles, we model the\naccretion of a series of up to four 1:10 mass ratio satellites then up to eight\n1:100 satellites and we search systematically for the signature of these\naccretions in these spaces. In all spaces considered (1) each satellite gives\norigin to several independent overdensities; (2) overdensities of multiple\nsatellites overlap; (3) satellites of different masses can produce similar\nsubstructures; (4) the overlap between the in-situ and the accreted population\nis considerable everywhere; (5) in-situ stars also form substructures in\nresponse to the satellite(s) accretion. These points are valid even if the\nsearch is restricted to kinematically-selected halo stars only. As we are now\nentering the 'Gaia era', our results warn that an extreme caution must be\nemployed before interpreting overdensities in any of those spaces as evidence\nof relics of accreted satellites. Reconstructing the accretion history of our\nGalaxy will require a substantial amount of accurate spectroscopic data, that,\ncomplemented by the kinematic information, will possibly allow us to\n(chemically) identify accreted streams and measure their orbital properties.\n(abridged)</td>

The first Gaia Data Release includes the\nTycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) information, which we use to analyze the\nV-[Fe/H] relation for a strictly selected sample with high enough astrometric\naccuracy. We aim to arrive at an explanation for the slopes of the V-[Fe/H]\nrelationship. We measure the V-[Fe/H] relation for thin and thick disk stars\nclassified on the basis of their [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H] abundances. We find\ndV/d[Fe/H]= -18 +/- 2 km/s/dex for stars in the thin disk and dV/d[Fe/H]= +23\n+/- 10 km/s/dex for thick disk stars, so we confirm the different signs for the\nslopes. The negative value of dV/d[Fe/H] for thick disk stars is consistent\nwith previous studies, but the combination of TGAS and APOGEE data provide\nhigher precision, even though systematic errors could exceed +/-5 km/s/dex .\nOur average measurement of dV/d[Fe/H] for local thick disk stars shows a\nsomewhat flatter slope than the previous studies, but we confirm a significant\nspread and a dependence of the slope on the [alpha/Fe] ratio of the stars.\nUsing a simple N-body model, we demonstrate that the observed trend for the\nthick and thin disk can be explained by the observed radial metallicity\ngradients and the correlation between orbital eccentricity and metallicity in\nthe thick disk.</td>

This paper is part of a series of\ndocuments explaining the data processing and its results for Gaia Data Release\n1, focussing on the G band photometry. Aims. This paper describes the\ncalibration model of the Gaia photometric passband for Gaia Data Release 1.\nMethods. The overall principle of splitting the process into internal and\nexternal calibrations is outlined. In the internal calibration, a\nself-consistent photometric system is generated. Then, the external calibration\nprovides the link to the absolute photometric flux scales. Results. The Gaia\nphotometric calibration pipeline explained here was applied to the first data\nrelease with good results. Details are given of the various calibration\nelements including the mathematical formulation of the models used and of the\nextraction and preparation of the required input parameters (e.g. colour\nterms). The external calibration in this first release provides the absolute\nzero point and photometric transformations from the Gaia G passband to other\ncommon photometric systems. Conclusions. This paper describes the photometric\ncalibration implemented for the first Gaia data release and the instrumental\neffects taken into account. For this first release no aperture losses,\nradiation damage, and other second-order effects have not yet been implemented\nin the calibration.</td>

      <td>Hubble Space Telescope Proper Motions of Individual Stars in Stellar Streams: Orphan, Sagittarius, Lethe, and the New "Parallel" Stream</td>
      <td>We present a multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) study of stellar proper\nmotions (PMs) for four fields along the Orphan Stream. We determine absolute\nPMs of several individual stars per target field using established techniques\nthat utilize distant background galaxies to define a stationary reference\nframe. Five Orphan Stream stars are identified in one of the four fields based\non combined color-magnitude and PM information. The average PM is consistent\nwith the existing model of the Orphan stream by Newberg et al. In addition to\nthe Orphan stream stars, we detect stars that likely belong to other stellar\nstreams. To identify which stellar streams these stars belong to, we examine\nthe 2-d bulk motion of each group of stars on the sky by subtracting the PM\ncontribution of the solar motion (which is a function of position on the sky\nand distance) from the observed PMs, and comparing the vector of net motion\nwith the spatial extent of known stellar streams. By doing this, we identify\ncandidate stars in the Sagittarius and Lethe streams, and a newly-found stellar\nstream at a distance of ~17 kpc, which we tentatively name the "Parallel\nstream". Together with our Sagittarius stream study (Sohn et al., 2015, ApJ,\n803, 56), this work demonstrates that even in the Gaia era, HST will continue\nto be advantageous in measuring PMs of old stellar populations on a\nstar-by-star basis, especially for distances beyond ~10 kpc.</td>

      <td>We present a non-parametric model for inferring the three-dimensional (3D)\ndistribution of dust density in the Milky Way. Our approach uses the extinction\nmeasured towards stars at different locations in the Galaxy at approximately\nknown distances. Each extinction measurement is proportional to the integrated\ndust density along its line-of-sight. Making simple assumptions about the\nspatial correlation of the dust density, we can infer the most probable 3D\ndistribution of dust across the entire observed region, including along sight\nlines which were not observed. This is possible because our model employs a\nGaussian Process to connect all lines-of-sight. We demonstrate the capability\nof our model to capture detailed dust density variations using mock data as\nwell as simulated data from the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot. We then apply our\nmethod to a sample of giant stars observed by APOGEE and Kepler to construct a\n3D dust map over a small region of the Galaxy. Due to our smoothness constraint\nand its isotropy, we provide one of the first maps which does not show the\n"fingers of god" effect.</td>

      <td>Asteroseismic versus Gaia distances: a first comparison</td>
      <td>Context. The Kepler space mission led to a large amount of high-precision\ntime series of solar-like oscillators. Using a Bayesian analysis that combines\nasteroseismic techniques and additional ground-based observations, the mass,\nradius, luminosity, and distance of those stars can be estimated with good\nprecision. This has given a new impetus to the research field of galactic\narcheology. Aims. The first data release of the Gaia space mission contains the\nTGAS catalog with parallax estimates for more than 2 million stars, including\nmany of the Kepler targets. Our goal is to make a first proper comparison of\nasteroseismic and astrometric parallaxes of a selection of dwarfs, subgiants,\nand red giants observed by Kepler for which asteroseismic distances were\npublished. Methods. We compare asteroseismic and astrometric distances of\nsolar-like pulsators using an appropriate statistical errors-in- variables\nmodel on a linear as well as on a logarithmic scale. Results. For a sample of\n22 dwarf and subgiant solar-like oscillators, the TGAS parallaxes considerably\nimproved the Hipparcos ones, yet the excellent agreement between asteroseismic\nand astrometric distances still holds. For a sample of 938 Kepler pulsating red\ngiants, the TGAS parallaxes are much more uncertain than the asteroseismic\nones, making it worthwhile to validate the former with the latter. From\nerrors-in-variables modelling we find a significant discrepancy between the\nTGAS parallaxes and the asteroseismic ones. Conclusions. For the sample of\ndwarfs and subgiants, the comparison between astrometric and asteroseismic\nparallaxes does not require a revision of the stellar models on the basis of\nTGAS. For the sample of red giants, we identify possible causes of the\ndiscrepancy, which we will likely be able to resolve with the more precise Gaia\nparallaxes of the upcoming releases.</td>

      <td>Stellar streams result from the tidal disruption of satellites and star\nclusters as they orbit a host galaxy, and can be very sensitive probes of the\ngravitational potential of the host system. We select and study narrow stellar\nstreams formed in a Milky-Way-like dark matter halo of the Aquarius suite of\ncosmological simulations, to determine if these streams can be used to\nconstrain the present day characteristic parameters of the halo's gravitational\npotential. We find that orbits integrated in static spherical and triaxial NFW\npotentials both reproduce the locations and kinematics of the various streams\nreasonably well. To quantify this further, we determine the best-fit potential\nparameters by maximizing the amount of clustering of the stream stars in the\nspace of their actions. We show that using our set of Aquarius streams, we\nrecover a mass profile that is consistent with the spherically-averaged dark\nmatter profile of the host halo, although we ignored both triaxiality and time\nevolution in the fit. This gives us confidence that such methods can be applied\nto the many streams that will be discovered by the Gaia mission to determine\nthe gravitational potential of our Galaxy.</td>

We analyze new observations from HST to derive the\nmasses and evolutionary status of their central stars (CSs) in order to better\nunderstand the relationship between the CS properties and those of the\nsurrounding nebulae. We also compare this sample with others we obtained using\nthe same technique in different metallicity environments: the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds. We work with HST/WFC3 images of 51 targets obtained in a\nsnapshot survey (GO-11657). The high spatial resolution of HST allows us to\nresolve these compact PNe and distinguish the CS emission from that of their\nsurrounding PNe. The targets were imaged through the filters F200LP, F350LP,\nand F814W from which we derive Johnson V and I magnitudes. We derive CS\nbolometric luminosities and effective temperatures using the Zanstra technique,\nfrom a combination of HST photometry and ground-based spectroscopic data. We\npresent new unique photometric measurements of 50 CSs, and derived effective\ntemperatures and luminosities for most of them. Central star masses for 23\ntargets were derived by placing the stars on a temperature-luminosity diagram\nand compare their location with the best available single star post-AGB\nevolutionary tracks, the remaining masses were indeterminate most likely\nbecause of underestimates of the stellar temperature, or because of substantial\nerrors in the adopted statistical distances to these objects. The distribution\nof CS masses in the sample of compact PNe is different than sample in the LMC\nand SMC, but with a median mass of 0.59 solar masses it is similar to other\nGalactic samples. We conclude that the compact nature of many of the PNe is a\nresult of their large distance, rather than their physical dimension.</td>

      <td>Milky Way Mass Models for Orbit Calculations</td>
      <td>Studying the trajectories of objects like stars, globular clusters or\nsatellite galaxies in the Milky Way allows to trace the dark matter halo but\nrequires reliable models of its gravitational potential. Realistic, yet simple\nand fully analytical models have already been presented in the past. However,\nimproved as well as new observational constraints have become available in the\nmeantime calling for a recalibration of the respective model parameters. Three\nwidely used model potentials are revisited. By a simultaneous least-squared fit\nto the observed rotation curve, in-plane proper motion of Sgr A*, local\nmass/surface density and the velocity dispersion in Baade's window, parameters\nof the potentials are brought up-to-date. The mass at large radii - and thus in\nparticular that of the dark matter halo - is hereby constrained by imposing\nthat the most extreme halo blue horizontal-branch star known has to be bound to\nthe Milky Way. The Galactic mass models are tuned to yield a very good match to\nrecent observations. The mass of the dark matter halo is - within the\nlimitations of the applied models - estimated in a fully consistent way. As a\nfirst application, the trajectory of the hypervelocity star HE 0437-5439 is\nre-investigated to check its suggested origin in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC). Despite their simplicity, the presented Milky Way mass models are well\nable to reproduce all observational constraints. Their analytical and simple\nform makes them ideally suited for fast and accurate orbit calculations. The\nLMC cannot be ruled out as HE 0437-5439's birthplace.</td>

      <td>Galactic Archaeology with asteroseismology and spectroscopy: Red giants observed by CoRoT and APOGEE</td>
      <td>With the advent of the space missions CoRoT and Kepler, it has become\nfeasible to determine precise asteroseismic masses and ages for large samples\nof red-giant stars. In this paper, we present the CoRoGEE dataset -- obtained\nfrom CoRoT lightcurves for 606 red giant stars in two fields of the Galactic\ndisc which have been co-observed for an ancillary project of APOGEE. We have\nused the Bayesian parameter estimation code PARAM to calculate distances,\nextinctions, masses, and ages for these stars in a homogeneous analysis,\nresulting in relative statistical uncertainties of $\sim2\%$ in distance,\n$\sim4\%$ in radius, $\sim9\%$ in mass and $\sim25\%$ in age. We also assess\nsystematic age uncertainties due to different input physics and mass loss. We\ndiscuss the correlation between ages and chemical abundance patterns of field\nstars over a large radial range of the Milky Way's disc (5 kpc $<R_{\rm Gal}<$\n14 kpc), focussing on the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]-age plane in five radial bins of\nthe Galactic disc. We find an overall agreement with the expectations of\nchemical-evolution models computed before the present data were available,\nespecially for the outer regions. However, our data also indicate that a\nsignificant fraction of stars now observed near and beyond the Solar\nNeighbourhood migrated from inner regions. Mock CoRoGEE observations of a\nchemo-dynamical Milky Way disc model show that the number of high-metallicity\nstars in the outer disc is too high to be accounted for even by the strong\nradial mixing present in the model. The mock observations also reveal that the\nage distribution of the [$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced sequence in the CoRoGEE\ninner-disc field is much broader than expected from a combination of radial\nmixing and observational errors. We suggest that a thick disc/bulge component\nthat formed stars for more than 3 Gyr may account for these discrepancies.</td>

      <td>The AMBRE Project: Constraining the lithium evolution in the Milky Way</td>
      <td>The chemical evolution of lithium in the Milky Way represents a major problem\nin modern astrophysics. Indeed, lithium is, on the one hand, easily destroyed\nin stellar interiors, and, on the other hand, produced at some specific stellar\nevolutionary stages that are still not well constrained. The goal of this paper\nis to investigate the lithium stellar content of Milky Way stars in order to\nput constraints on the lithium chemical enrichment in our Galaxy, in particular\nin both the thin and thick discs. Thanks to high-resolution spectra from the\nESO archive and high quality atmospheric parameters, we were able to build a\nmassive and homogeneous catalogue of lithium abundances for 7300 stars derived\nwith an automatic method coupling, a synthetic spectra grid, and a Gauss-Newton\nalgorithm. We validated these lithium abundances with literature values,\nincluding those of the Gaia benchmark stars. In terms of lithium galactic\nevolution, we show that the interstellar lithium abundance increases with\nmetallicity by 1 dex from [M/H]=-1 dex to +0.0 dex. Moreover, we find that this\nlithium ISM abundance decreases by about 0.5 dex at super-solar metalllicity.\nBased on a chemical separation, we also observed that the stellar lithium\ncontent in the thick disc increases rather slightly with metallicity, while the\nthin disc shows a steeper increase. The lithium abundance distribution of\nalpha-rich, metal-rich stars has a peak at A(Li)~3 dex. We conclude that the\nthick disc stars suffered of a low lithium chemical enrichment, showing lithium\nabundances rather close to the Spite plateau while the thin disc stars clearly\nshow an increasing lithium chemical enrichment with the metallicity, probably\nthanks to the contribution of low-mass stars.</td>

      <td>On the estimation of stellar parameters with uncertainty prediction from Generative Artificial Neural Networks: application to Gaia RVS simulated spectra</td>
      <td>Aims. We present an innovative artificial neural network (ANN) architecture,\ncalled Generative ANN (GANN), that computes the forward model, that is it\nlearns the function that relates the unknown outputs (stellar atmospheric\nparameters, in this case) to the given inputs (spectra). Such a model can be\nintegrated in a Bayesian framework to estimate the posterior distribution of\nthe outputs. Methods. The architecture of the GANN follows the same scheme as a\nnormal ANN, but with the inputs and outputs inverted. We train the network with\nthe set of atmospheric parameters (Teff, logg, [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]),\nobtaining the stellar spectra for such inputs. The residuals between the\nspectra in the grid and the estimated spectra are minimized using a validation\ndataset to keep solutions as general as possible. Results. The performance of\nboth conventional ANNs and GANNs to estimate the stellar parameters as a\nfunction of the star brightness is presented and compared for different\nGalactic populations. GANNs provide significantly improved parameterizations\nfor early and intermediate spectral types with rich and intermediate\nmetallicities. The behaviour of both algorithms is very similar for our sample\nof late-type stars, obtaining residuals in the derivation of [Fe/H] and\n[alpha/Fe] below 0.1dex for stars with Gaia magnitude Grvs<12, which accounts\nfor a number in the order of four million stars to be observed by the Radial\nVelocity Spectrograph of the Gaia satellite. Conclusions. Uncertainty\nestimation of computed astrophysical parameters is crucial for the validation\nof the parameterization itself and for the subsequent exploitation by the\nastronomical community. GANNs produce not only the parameters for a given\nspectrum, but a goodness-of-fit between the observed spectrum and the predicted\none for a given set of parameters.

We apply probabilistic chemical selection criteria to separate\nour sample into $\alpha$-low (`thin disc') and $\alpha$-high (`thick disc')\nsequences. Using newly derived distances, which will be utilized in the\nupcoming RAVE DR5, we explore the kinematic trends as a function of metallicity\nfor each of the disc components. For our $\alpha$-low disc, we find a negative\ntrend in the mean rotational velocity ($V_{\mathrm{\phi}}$) as a function of\niron abundance ([Fe/H]). We measure a positive gradient $\partial\nV_{\mathrm{\phi}}$/$\partial$[Fe/H] for the $\alpha$-high disc, consistent with\nresults from high-resolution surveys. We also find differences between the\n$\alpha$-low and $\alpha$-high discs in all three components of velocity\ndispersion. We discuss the implications of an $\alpha$-low, metal-rich\npopulation originating from the inner Galaxy, where the orbits of these stars\nhave been significantly altered by radial mixing mechanisms in order to bring\nthem into the solar neighbourhood. The probabilistic separation we propose can\nbe extended to other data sets for which the accuracy in [$\alpha$/Fe] is not\nsufficient to disentangle the chemical disc components a priori. For such\ndatasets which will also have significant overlap with Gaia DR1, we can\ntherefore make full use of the improved parallax and proper motion data as it\nbecomes available to investigate kinematic trends in these chemical disc\ncomponents.</td>

The ages have been calculated from the positions of the stars on the\nHertzsprung--Russell diagram relative to the isochrones from the Padova\ndatabase by taking into account the extinction from the previously constructed\n3D analytical model and extinction coefficient $R_V$ from the 3D map of its\nvariations.

The velocity dispersion\nvariations are well fitted by power laws the deviations from which are\nexplained by the influence of predominantly radial stellar streams: Sirius,\nHyades, $\alpha$~Cet/Wolf~630, and Hercules. The accuracy of determining the\nsolar motion relative to the local standard of rest is shown to be\nfundamentally limited due to these variations of stellar kinematics. The\ndeviations of our results from those of Dehnen and Binney (1998), the\nGeneva--Copenhagen survey of dwarfs, and the Besancon model of the Galaxy are\nexplained by the use of PCRV radial velocities with corrected systematic\nerrors.</td>

      <td>We present a new theoretical population synthesis model (the Galaxy Model) to\nexamine and deal with large amounts of data from surveys of the Milky Way and\nto decipher the present and past structure and history of our own Galaxy. We\nassume the Galaxy to consist of a superposition of many composite stellar\npopulations belonging to the thin and thick disks, the stellar halo and the\nbulge, and to be surrounded by a single dark matter halo component. A global\nmodel for the Milky Way's gravitational potential is built up self-consistently\nwith the density profiles from the Poisson equation. In turn, these density\nprofiles are used to generate synthetic probability distribution functions\n(PDFs) for the distribution of stars in colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs).\nFinally, the gravitational potential is used to constrain the stellar\nkinematics by means of the moment method on a (perturbed)-distribution\nfunction. Spiral arms perturb the axisymmetric disk distribution functions in\nthe linear response framework of density-wave theory where we present an\nanalytical formula of the so-called `reduction factor' using Hypergeometric\nfunctions. Finally, we consider an analytical non-axisymmetric model of\nextinction and an algorithm based on the concept of probability distribution\nfunction to handle colour magnitude diagrams with a large number of stars. A\ngenetic algorithm is presented to investigate both the photometric and\nkinematic parameter space.

Our study is based\non the two samples with the best established completeness and most precise\natmospheric parameters, the volume-complete survey within 20 pc and the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) magnitude-limited sample. We explore the modelling of\nthe observed mass distributions with Monte Carlo simulations, but find that it\nis difficult to constrain independently the initial mass function (IMF), the\ninitial-to-final-mass relation (IFMR), the stellar formation history (SFH), the\nvariation of the Galactic disk vertical scale height as a function of stellar\nage, and binary evolution. Each of these input ingredients has a moderate\neffect on the predicted mass distributions, and we must also take into account\nbiases owing to unidentified faint objects (20 pc sample), as well as unknown\nmasses for magnetic white dwarfs and spectroscopic calibration issues (SDSS\nsample). Nevertheless, we find that fixed standard assumptions for the above\nparameters result in predicted mean masses that are in good qualitative\nagreement with the observed values. It suggests that derived masses for both\nstudied samples are consistent with our current knowledge of stellar and\nGalactic evolution. Our simulations overpredict by 40-50% the number of massive\nwhite dwarfs (M > 0.75 Msun) for both surveys, although we can not exclude a\nSalpeter IMF when we account for all biases. Furthermore, we find no evidence\nof a population of double white dwarf mergers in the observed mass\ndistributions.</td>

      <td>Inferences about the spatial density or phase-space structure of stellar\npopulations in the Milky Way require a precise determination of the effective\nsurvey volume. The volume observed by surveys such as Gaia or near-infrared\nspectroscopic surveys, which have good coverage of the Galactic mid-plane\nregion, is highly complex because of the abundant small-scale structure in the\nthree-dimensional interstellar dust extinction. We introduce a novel framework\nfor analyzing the importance of small-scale structure in the extinction. This\nformalism demonstrates that the spatially-complex effect of extinction on the\nselection function of a pencil-beam or contiguous sky survey is equivalent to a\nlow-pass filtering of the extinction-affected selection function with the\nsmooth density field. We find that the angular resolution of current 3D\nextinction maps is sufficient for analyzing Gaia sub-samples of millions of\nstars. However, the current distance resolution is inadequate and needs to be\nimproved by an order of magnitude, especially in the inner Galaxy. We also\npresent a practical and efficient method for properly taking the effect of\nextinction into account in analyses of Galactic structure through an effective\nselection function. We illustrate its use with the selection function of\nred-clump stars in APOGEE using and comparing a variety of current 3D\nextinction maps.</td>

RoadMapping models the observed positions and\nvelocities of stars with a parametrized, three-integral distribution function\n(DF) in a parametrized axisymmetric potential. We investigate through\ndifferential test cases with idealized mock data how the breakdown of model\nassumptions and data properties affect constraints on the potential and DF. Our\nkey results are: (i) If the MW's true potential is not included in the assumed\nmodel potential family, we can - in the axisymmetric case - still find a robust\nestimate for the potential, with only <~ 10% difference in surface density\nwithin |z| <= 1.1 kpc inside the observed volume. (ii) Modest systematic\ndifferences between the true and model DF are inconsequential. E.g, when\nbinning stars to define sub-populations with simple DFs, binning errors do not\naffect the modelling as long as the DF parameters of neighbouring bins differ\nby < 20%. In addition, RoadMapping ensures unbiased potential estimates for\neither (iii) small misjudgements of the spatial selection function (i.e., <~\n15% at the survey volume's edge), (iv) if distances are known to within 10%, or\n(v) if proper motion uncertainties are known within 10% or are smaller than\ndelta mu <~ 1 mas/yr. Challenges are the rapidly increasing computational costs\nfor large sample sizes. Overall, RoadMapping is well suited to making precise\nnew measurements of the MW's potential with data from the upcoming Gaia\nreleases.</td>

We investigate the\nmetallicity gradient of the inner disk using a sample of inner disk open\nclusters that is three times larger than has previously been studied in the\nliterature to better characterize the gradient in this part of the disk. We\nused the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) [Fe/H] values and stellar parameters for stars\nin 12 open clusters in the inner disk from GES-UVES data. Cluster mean [Fe/H]\nvalues were determined based on a membership analysis for each cluster. Where\nnecessary, distances and ages to clusters were determined via comparison to\ntheoretical isochrones. The GES open clusters exhibit a radial metallicity\ngradient of -0.10+-0.02 dex/kpc, consistent with the gradient measured by other\nliterature studies of field red giant stars and open clusters in the range R_GC\n~ 6-12 kpc. We also measure a trend of increasing [Fe/H] with increasing\ncluster age, as has also been found in the literature. We find no evidence for\na steepening of the inner disk metallicity gradient inside the solar circle as\nearlier studies indicated. The age-metallicity relation shown by the clusters\nis consistent with that predicted by chemical evolution models that include the\neffects of radial migration, but a more detailed comparison between cluster\nobservations and models would be premature.</td>

      <td>The EMBLA Survey -- Metal-poor stars in the Galactic bulge</td>
      <td>Cosmological models predict the oldest stars in the Galaxy should be found\nclosest to the centre of the potential well, in the bulge. The EMBLA Survey\nsuccessfully searched for these old, metal-poor stars by making use of the\ndistinctive SkyMapper photometric filters to discover candidate metal-poor\nstars in the bulge. Their metal-poor nature was then confirmed using the\nAAOmega spectrograph on the AAT. Here we present an abundance analysis of 10\nbulge stars with -2.8<[Fe/H]<-1.7 from MIKE/Magellan observations, in total\ndetermining the abundances of 22 elements. Combining these results with our\nprevious high-resolution data taken as part of the Gaia-ESO Survey, we have\nstarted to put together a picture of the chemical and kinematic nature of the\nmost metal-poor stars in the bulge. The currently available kinematic data is\nconsistent with the stars belonging to the bulge, although more accurate\nmeasurements are needed to constrain the stars' orbits. The chemistry of these\nbulge stars deviates from that found in halo stars of the same metallicity. Two\nnotable differences are the absence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor bulge stars,\nand the alpha-element abundances exhibit a large intrinsic scatter and include\nstars which are underabundant in these typically enhanced elements.</td>

      <td>Updated Kinematic Constraints on a Dark Disk</td>
      <td>We update the method of the Holmberg & Flynn (2000) study, including an\nupdated model of the Milky Way's interstellar gas, radial velocities, an\nupdated reddening map, and a careful statistical analysis, to bound the allowed\nsurface density and scale height of a dark disk. We pay careful attention to\nthe self-consistency of the model, including the gravitational influence of the\ndark disk on other disk components, and to the net velocity of the tracer\nstars. We find that the data set exhibits a non-zero bulk velocity in the\nvertical direction as well as a displacement from the expected location at the\nGalactic midplane. If not properly accounted for, these features would bias the\nbound toward low dark disk mass. We therefore perform our analysis two ways. In\nthe first, traditional method, we subtract the mean velocity and displacement\nfrom the tracers' phase space distributions. In the second method, we perform a\nnon-equilibrium version of the HF method to derive a bound on the dark disk\nparameters for an oscillating tracer distribution. Despite updates in the mass\nmodel and reddening map, the traditional method results remain consistent with\nthose of HF2000. The second, non-equilibrium technique, however, allows a\nsurface density as large as $14\, M_\odot\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ (and as small as 0),\ndemonstrating much weaker constraints. For both techniques, the bound on\nsurface density is weaker for larger scale height. In future analyses of Gaia\ndata, it will be important to verify whether the tracer populations are in\nequilibrium.</td>

However, the lack of a large number of OCs analyzed\nhomogeneously hampers the investigations about chemical patterns and the\nexistence of Galactocentric radial and vertical gradients, or an\nage-metallicity relation. To overcome this, we have designed the Open Cluster\nChemical Abundances from Spanish Observatories survey (OCCASO). We aim to\nprovide homogeneous radial velocities, physical parameters and individual\nchemical abundances of six or more Red Clump stars for a sample of 25 old and\nintermediate-age OCs visible from the Northern hemisphere.

We include clusters never\nstudied with high-resolution spectroscopy before (NGC~1907, NGC~6991,\nNGC~7762), and clusters in common with other large spectroscopic surveys like\nthe Gaia-ESO Survey (NGC~6705) and APOGEE (NGC~2682 and NGC~6819). We perform\ninternal comparisons between instruments to evaluate and correct internal\nsystematics of the results, and compare our radial velocities with previous\ndeterminations in the literature, when available. Finally, radial velocities\nfor each cluster are used to perform a preliminar kinematic study in relation\nwith the Galactic disc.</td>

We also estimate the Gaia capabilities\nof detecting the predicted signatures. We use both controlled orbital\nintegrations in analytic potentials and self-consistent simulations. We\nintroduce a new strategy, which consists of comparing the stellar kinematics of\nsymmetric Galactic longitudes (+l and -l), in particular the median transverse\nvelocity (from parallaxes and proper motions). This approach does not require\nthe assumption of an axisymmetric model. The typical differences between the\ntransverse velocity in symmetric longitudes in the models are of ~2 km/s, but\ncan be larger than 10 km/s for certain longitudes and distances. The kinematic\ndifferences for +l and -l show trends that depend on the properties of spiral\narms. Thus, this method can be used to quantify the importance of the effects\nof spiral arms on the orbits of stars in the different disk regions, and to\nconstrain the location of the arms, main resonances and, thus, pattern speed.\nMoreover, the method allows us to test the dynamical nature of the spiral\nstructure (e.g. grand design versus transient multiple arms). We estimate the\nnumber of stars of each spectral type that Gaia will observe in representative\nGalactic longitudes, their errors in distance and transverse velocity, and the\nerror in computing the median velocity as a function of distance. We will be\nable to measure the median transverse velocity with Gaia data, with precision\nsmaller than ~1 km/s up to distances of ~4-6 kpc for certain giant stars, and\nup to ~2-4 kpc and better kinematic precision (<= 0.5 km\s) for certain\nsub-giants and dwarfs. These are enough to measure the typical signatures seen\nin the models. We also show that a similar strategy can be used with\nline-of-sight velocities from other upcoming spectroscopic surveys.(Abridged)</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Sodium and aluminium abundances in giants and dwarfs - Implications for stellar and Galactic chemical evolution</td>
      <td>Stellar evolution models predict that internal mixing should cause some\nsodium overabundance at the surface of red giants more massive than ~ 1.5--2.0\nMsun. The surface aluminium abundance should not be affected. Nevertheless,\nobservational results disagree about the presence and/or the degree of the Na\nand Al overabundances. In addition, Galactic chemical evolution models adopting\ndifferent stellar yields lead to quite different predictions for the behavior\nof [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. Overall, the observed trends of these\nabundances with metallicity are not well reproduced. We readdress both issues,\nusing new Na and Al abundances determined within the Gaia-ESO Survey, using two\nsamples: i) more than 600 dwarfs of the solar neighborhood and of open clusters\nand ii) low- and intermediate-mass clump giants in six open clusters.\nAbundances of Na in giants with mass below ~2.0 Msun, and of Al in giants below\n~3.0 Msun, seem to be unaffected by internal mixing processes. For more massive\ngiants, the Na overabundance increases with stellar mass. This trend agrees\nwell with predictions of stellar evolutionary models. Chemical evolution models\nthat are able to fit well the observed [Na/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trend in solar\nneighborhood dwarfs can not simultaneously explain the run of [Al/Fe] with\n[Fe/H], and viceversa. The comparison with stellar ages is hampered by severe\nuncertainties. Indeed, reliable age estimates are available for only a half of\nthe stars of the sample. We conclude that Al is underproduced by the models,\nexcept for stellar ages younger than about 7 Gyr. In addition, some significant\nsource of late Na production seems to be missing in the models. Either current\nNa and Al yields are affected by large uncertainties, and/or some important\nGalactic source(s) of these elements has not been taken into account up to now.\n[abridged]</td>

By calculating the ratio of the number of\nsimulated solar siblings to that of the number of stars in a model Galactic\ndisk, we find that this ratio is above 0.5 in the region given by: $\varpi \geq\n5$mas, $4 \leq \mu \leq 6$masyr$^{-1}$, and $-2\leq V_\mathrm{r} \leq\n0$kms$^{-1}$.

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Separating disk chemical substructures with cluster models</td>
      <td>(Abridged) Recent spectroscopic surveys have begun to explore the Galactic\ndisk system outside the solar neighborhood on the basis of large data samples.\nIn this way, they provide valuable information for testing spatial and temporal\nvariations of disk structure kinematics and chemical evolution. We used a\nGaussian mixture model algorithm, as a rigurous mathematical approach, to\nseparate in the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane a clean disk star subsample from the\nGaia-ESO survey internal data release 2. We find that the sample is separated\ninto five groups associated with major Galactic components; the metal-rich end\nof the halo, the thick disk, and three subgroups for the thin disk sequence.\nThis is confirmed with a sample of red clump stars from the Apache Point\nObservatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. The two\nmetal-intermediate and metal-rich groups of the thin disk decomposition\n([Fe/H]>-0.25 dex) highlight a change in the slope at solar metallicity. This\nholds true at different radial regions. The distribution of Galactocentric\nradial distances of the metal-poor part of the thin disk ([Fe/H]<-0.25 dex) is\nshifted to larger distances than those of the more metal-rich parts. Moreover,\nthe metal-poor part of the thin disk presents indications of a scale height\nintermediate between those of the thick and the rest of the thin disk, and it\ndisplays higher azimuthal velocities than the latter. These stars might have\nformed and evolved in parallel and/or dissociated from the inside-out formation\ntaking place in the internal thin disk. Their enhancement levels might be due\nto their origin from gas pre-enriched by outflows from the thick disk or the\ninner halo. The smooth trends of their properties (their spatial distribution\nwith respect to the plane, in particular) with [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] suggested by\nthe data indicates a quiet dynamical evolution, with no relevant merger events.</td>

I conclude with the prospects and\nsynergies that astrometric (Gaia) and asteroseismic space-borne missions\nreserve to the field of Galactic Archaeology, and advocate that survey\nselection functions should be kept as simple as possible, relying on basic\nobservables such as colours and magnitudes only.</td>

      <td>Stellar Velocity Dispersion and Anisotropy of the Milky Way Inner Halo</td>
      <td>We measure the three components of velocity dispersion,\n$\sigma_{R},\sigma_{\theta},\sigma_{\phi}$, for stars within 6 < R < 30 kpc of\nthe Milky Way using a new radial velocity sample from the MMT telescope. We\ncombine our measurements with previously published data so that we can more\nfinely sample the stellar halo. We use a maximum likelihood statistical method\nfor estimating mean velocities, dispersions, and covariances assuming only that\nvelocities are normally distributed. The alignment of the velocity ellipsoid is\nconsistent with a spherically symmetric gravitational potential. From the\nspherical Jeans equation, the mass of the Milky Way is M(<12 kpc) =\n$1.3\times10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ with an uncertainty of 40%. We also find a\nregion of discontinuity, 15 < R < 25 kpc, where the estimated velocity\ndispersions and anisotropies diverge from their anticipated values, confirming\nat high significance the break observed by others. We argue that this break in\nanisotropy is physically explained by coherent stellar velocity structure in\nthe halo, such as the Sgr stream. To significantly improve our understanding of\nhalo kinematics will require combining radial velocities with future Gaia\nproper motions.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: New constraints on the Galactic disc velocity dispersion and its chemical dependencies</td>
      <td>Understanding the history and the evolution of the Milky Way disc is one of\nthe main goals of modern astrophysics. We study the velocity dispersion\nbehaviour of Galactic disc stars as a function of the [Mg/Fe] ratio, which can\nbe used as a proxy of relative age. This key relation is essential to constrain\nthe formation mechanisms of the disc stellar populations as well as the cooling\nprocesses. We used the recommended parameters and chemical abundances of 7800\nFGK Milky Way field stars from the second internal data release of the Gaia-ESO\nSurvey. These stars were observed with the GIRAFFE spectrograph, and cover a\nlarge spatial volume (6<R<10kpc and |Z|<2kpc). Based on the [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H]\nratios, we separated the thin- from the thick-disc sequence. From analysing the\nGalactocentric velocity of the stars for the thin disc, we find a weak positive\ncorrelation between Vphi and [Fe/H], due to a slowly rotating Fe-poor tail. For\nthe thick disc, a strong correlation with [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] is established. We\nhave detected an inversion of the radial velocity dispersion with [Mg/Fe] for\nthick-disc stars with [Fe/H]<-0.1dex and [Mg/Fe]>+0.2dex. First, the velocity\ndispersion increases with [Mg/Fe] at all [Fe/H] ratios for the thin-disc stars,\nand then it decreases for the thick-disc at the highest [Mg/Fe] abundances.\nSimilar trends are observed within the errors for the azimuthal velocity\ndispersion, while a continuous increase with [Mg/Fe] is observed for the\nvertical velocity dispersion. The velocity dispersion decrease agrees with\nprevious measurements of the RAVE survey, although it is observed here for a\ngreater metallicity interval and a larger spatial volume. We confirm the\nexistence of [Mg/Fe]-rich thick-disc stars with cool kinematics in the\ngenerally turbulent context of the primitive Galactic disc. This is discussed\nin the framework of the different disc formation scenarios.</td>

      <td>The presence of two red clumps (RCs) in high latitude fields of the Milky Way\nbulge is interpreted as evidence for an X-shaped structure originated from the\nbar instability. Here we show, however, that this double RC phenomenon is more\nlikely to be another manifestation of multiple populations observed in globular\nclusters (GCs) in the metal-rich regime. As in the bulge GC Terzan 5, the\nhelium enhanced second generation stars (G2) in the classical bulge component\nof the Milky Way are placed on the bright RC, which is about 0.5 mag brighter\nthan the normal RC originated from the first generation stars (G1), producing\nthe observed double RC. In a composite bulge, where a classical bulge can\ncoexist with a boxy pseudo bulge, our models can also reproduce key\nobservations, such as the dependence of the double RC feature on metallicity\nand Galactic latitude and longitude. If confirmed by Gaia trigonometric\nparallax distances, this would indicate that the Milky Way bar is not\nsufficiently buckled to form the X-shaped structure in the bulge, and suggest\nthat the early-type galaxies would be similarly prevailed by super-helium-rich\nsubpopulation.</td>

The observed overdensities\ncan be interpreted as fossil substructures consisting of streamers torn from\ntheir progenitors, such progenitors appear to be satellites on prograde and\nretrograde orbits on different inclinations. In particular, of the five\ndetected overdensities, two appear to be associated, yelding twenty-one\nadditional main-sequence members, with the stream of Helmi et al. (1999) that\nour analysis confirms on a high inclination prograde orbit. The three newly\nidentified kinematic groups could be associated with the retrograde streams\ndetected by Dinescu (2002) and Kepley et al. (2007), whatever their origin, the\nprogenitor(s) would be on retrograde orbit(s) and inclination(s) within the\nrange $10^{\circ} \div 60^{\circ}$.

The\nseparation we find in velocity space allows us to investigate, in a novel\nmanner, the extent in metallicity of each of the two sequences, identifying\nthem with the two discs, without making any assumption about the shape of their\nmetallicity distribution functions. Then, using the separation in chemical\nspace, we characterise the spatial variation of the slopes of the [alpha/Fe] -\n[Fe/H] sequences for the thick and thin discs and the way in which the relative\nproportions of the two discs change across the Galaxy.\n  We find that the thick disc (high-alpha sequence), extends up to [Fe/H]~ +0.2\nand the thin disc (low-alpha sequence), at least down to [Fe/H]~ -0.8. Radial\nand vertical gradients in alpha-abundances are found for the thin disc, with\nmild spatial variations in its [alpha/Fe] - [Fe/H] paths, whereas for the thick\ndisc we do not detect any such spatial variations.\n  The small variations in the spatial [alpha/Fe] - [Fe/H] paths of the thin\ndisc do not allow us to distinguish between formation models of this structure.\nOn the other hand, the lack of radial gradients and [alpha/Fe] - [Fe/H]\nvariations for the thick disc indicate that the mechanism responsible for the\nmixing of the metals in the young Galaxy (e.g. radial stellar migration or\nturbulent gaseous disc) was more efficient before the (present) thin disc\nstarted forming.</td>

The method is based on the Wavelet Transform\nand searches for over-densities in the combined space of sky coordinates and\nproper motions, using kinematics in the search for the first time. We test the\nmethod with a Gaia mock catalogue that has the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot\n(GUMS) as a background, and use a library of around 30 000 UFDGs simulated as\nPlummer spheres with a single stellar population. For the UFDGs we use a wide\nrange of structural and orbital parameters that go beyond the range spanned by\nreal systems, where some UFDGs may remain undetected. We characterize the\ndetection limits as function of the number of observable stars by Gaia in the\nUFDGs with respect to that of the background and their apparent sizes in the\nsky and proper motion planes. We find that the addition of proper motions in\nthe search improves considerably the detections compared to a photometric\nsurvey at the same magnitude limit. Our experiments suggest that Gaia will be\nable to detect UFDGs that are similar to some of the known UFDGs even if the\nlimit of Gaia is around 2 magnitudes brighter than that of SDSS, with the\nadvantage of having a full-sky catalogue. We also see that Gaia could even find\nsome UFDGs that have lower surface brightness than the SDSS limit.</td>

      <td>Tidal debris from infalling satellites can leave observable structure in the\nphase-space distribution of the Galactic halo. Such substructure can be\nmanifest in the spatial and/or velocity distributions of the stars in the halo.\nThis paper focuses on a class of substructure that is purely kinematic in\nnature, with no accompanying spatial features. To study its properties, we use\na simulated stellar halo created by dynamically populating the Via Lactea II\nhigh-resolution N-body simulation with stars. A significant fraction of the\nstars in the inner halo of Via Lactea share a common speed and metallicity,\ndespite the fact that they are spatially diffuse. We argue that this kinematic\nsubstructure is a generic feature of tidal debris from older mergers and may\nexplain the detection of radial-velocity substructure in the inner halo made by\nthe Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration. The GAIA\nsatellite, which will provide the proper motions of an unprecedented number of\nstars, should further characterize the kinematic substructure in the inner\nhalo. Our study of the Via Lactea simulation suggests that the stellar halo can\nbe used to map the speed distribution of the local dark-matter halo, which has\nimportant consequences for dark-matter direct-detection experiments.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Insights on the inner-disc evolution from open clusters</td>
      <td>Context. The inner disc, linking the thin disc with the bulge, has been\nsomehow neglected in the past because of intrinsic difficulties in its study,\ndue, e.g., to crowding and high extinction. Open clusters located in the inner\ndisc are among the best tracers of its chemistry at different ages and\ndistances. Aims. We analyse the chemical patterns of four open clusters located\nwithin 7 kpc of the Galactic Centre and of field stars to infer the properties\nof the inner disc with the Gaia-ESO survey idr2/3 data release. Methods. We\nderive the parameters of the newly observed cluster, Berkeley 81, finding an\nage of about 1 Gyr and a Galactocentric distance of 5.4 kpc. We construct the\nchemical patterns of clusters and we compare them with those of field stars in\nthe Solar neighbourhood and in the inner-disc samples. Results. Comparing the\nthree populations we observe that inner-disc clusters and field stars are both,\non average, enhanced in [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe]. Using the idr2/3 results\nof M67, we estimate the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effect on\nthe abundances of Mg and Si in giant stars. After empirically correcting for\nNLTE effects, we note that NGC 6705 and Be 81 still have a high [{\alpha}/Fe].\nConclusions. The location of the four open clusters and of the field population\nreveals that the evolution of the metallicity [Fe/H] and of [alpha/Fe] can be\nexplained within the framework of a simple chemical evolution model: both\n[Fe/H] and [{\alpha}/Fe] of Trumpler 20 and of NGC 4815 are in agreement with\nexpectations from a simple chemical evolution model. On the other hand, NGC\n6705, and at a lower level Berkeley 81, have higher [{\alpha}/Fe] than expected\nfor their ages, location in the disc, and metallicity. These differences might\noriginate from local enrichment processes as explained in the inhomogeneous\nevolution framework.</td>

With the aim of studying the biases of this approach, we\nfitted different analytic models to simulated observations obtained from a\nsuite of direct N-body simulations of star clusters in different stages of\ntheir evolution and under different levels of tidal stress to derive mass, mass\nfunction and degree of anisotropy. We find that masses can be\nunder/over-estimated up to 50% depending on the degree of relaxation reached by\nthe cluster, the available range of observed masses and distances of radial\nvelocity measures from the cluster center and the strength of the tidal field.\nThe mass function slope appears to be better constrainable and less sensitive\nto model inadequacies unless strongly dynamically evolved clusters and a\nnon-optimal location of the measured luminosity function are considered. The\ndegree and the characteristics of the anisotropy developed in the N-body\nsimulations are not adequately reproduced by popular analytic models and can be\ndetected only if accurate proper motions are available. We show how to reduce\nthe uncertainties in the mass, mass-function and anisotropy estimation and\nprovide predictions for the improvements expected when Gaia proper motions will\nbe available in the near future.</td>

      <td>Kinematics and chemistry of recently discovered Reticulum 2 and Horologium 1 dwarf galaxies</td>
      <td>Photometry alone is not sufficient to unambiguously distinguish between\nultra-faint star clusters and dwarf galaxies because of their overlap in\nmorphological properties. Here we report on VLT/GIRAFFE spectra of candidate\nmember stars in two recently discovered ultra-faint satellites Reticulum 2 and\nHorologium 1, obtained as part of the ongoing Gaia-ESO Survey. We identify 18\nmembers in Reticulum 2 and 5 in Horologium 1. We find Reticulum 2 to have a\nvelocity dispersion of ~3.22 km/s, implying a M/L ratio of ~ 500. We have\ninferred stellar parameters for all candidates and we find Reticulum 2 to have\na mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.46+/-0.1, with an intrinsic dispersion of ~\n0.29, and is alpha-enhanced to the level of [alpha/Fe]~0.4. We conclude that\nReticulum 2 is a dwarf galaxy. We also report on the serendipitous discovery of\nfour stars in a previously unknown stellar substructure near Reticulum 2 with\n[Fe/H] ~ -2 and V_hel ~ 220 km/s, far from the systemic velocity of Reticulum\n2. For Horologium 1 we infer a velocity dispersion of 4.9^{+2.8}_{-0.9} km/s\nand a consequent M/L ratio of ~ 600, leading us to conclude that Horologium 1\nis also a dwarf galaxy. Horologium 1 is slightly more metal-poor than Reticulum\n2 [Fe/H] = -2.76 +/- 0.1 and is similarly alpha-enhanced: [alpha/Fe] ~ 0.3.\nDespite a large error-bar, we also measure a significant spread of\nmetallicities of 0.17 dex which strengthen the evidence that Horologium 1 is\nindeed a dwarf galaxy. The line-of-sight velocity of Reticulum 2 is offset by\nsome 100 km/s from the prediction of the orbital velocity of the LMC, thus\nmaking its association with the Cloud uncertain. However, at the location of\nHorologium 1, both the backward integrated LMC's orbit and the LMC's halo are\npredicted to have radial velocities similar to that of the dwarf. Therefore, it\nis likely that Horologium 1 is or once was a member of the Magellanic Family.</td>

This is the first extensive study of this cluster from\nhigh resolution spectroscopy. We derive abundances of O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca,\nSc, Ti, Fe, Cr, Ni, Y, Ba, and La. We find a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.19\n$\pm$ 0.03 and find no evidence for a metallicity spread. This metallicity\nmakes NGC 4372 one of the most metal-poor galactic globular clusters. We also\nfind an {\alpha}-enhancement typical of halo globular clusters at this\nmetallicity. Significant spreads are observed in the abundances of light\nelements. In particular we find a Na-O anti-correlation. Abundances of O are\nrelatively high compared with other globular clusters. This could indicate that\nNGC 4372 was formed in an environment with high O for its metallicity. A Mg-Al\nspread is also present which spans a range of more than 0.5 dex in Al\nabundances. Na is correlated with Al and Mg abundances at a lower significance\nlevel. This pattern suggests that the Mg-Al burning cycle is active. This\nbehavior can also be seen in giant stars of other massive, metal-poor clusters.\nA relation between light and heavy s-process elements has been identified.</td>

      <td>The capability to reconstruct dissolved stellar systems in dynamical and\nchemical space is a key factor in improving our understanding of the evolution\nof the Milky Way. Here we concentrate on the dynamical aspect and given that a\nsignificant portion of the stars in the Milky Way have been born in stellar\nassociations or clusters that have lived a few Myr up to several Gyr, we\nfurther restrict our attention to the evolution of star clusters. We have\ncarried out our simulations in two steps: (1) we create a simulation of\ndissolution and mixing processes which yields a close fit to the present-day\nMilky Way dynamics and (2) we have evolved three sets of stellar clusters with\nmasses of 400, 1000 and 15000 M$_{\odot}$ to dissolution. The birth location of\nthese sets was 4, 6, 8 and 10 kpc for the 400 and 1000 M$_{\odot}$ clusters and\n4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 kpc for the 15000 M$_{\odot}$.

We give results for Solar twins and\nsiblings over a wide range of radii and cluster masses for two dissolution\nmechanisms. From kinematics alone, we conclude that the Sun was $\sim$50 per\ncent more likely to have been born near its current Galactocentric radius,\nrather than have migrated (radially) $\sim$2 kpc since birth. We conclude our\nanalysis by calculating magnitudes and colours of our single stars for\ncomparison with the samples that the $Gaia$, $Gaia$-ESO and GALAH-AAO surveys\nwill obtain. In terms of reconstructing dissolved star clusters we find that on\nshort time-scales we cannot rely on kinematic evolution alone and thus it will\nbe necessary to extend our study to include information on chemical space.</td>

Some of these ejected stars are expected to show strong\nAl enhancement at the expense of shortage of Mg, but until now no such star has\nbeen found. We search for outliers in the Mg and Al abundances of the few\nhundreds of halo field stars observed in the first eighteen months of the\nGaia-ESO public spectroscopic survey. One halo star at the base of the red\ngiant branch, here referred to as 22593757-4648029 is found to have\n[Mg/Fe]=-0.36+-0.04 and [Al/Fe]=0.99+-0.08, which is compatible with the most\nextreme ratios detected in GCs so far. We compare the orbit of 22593757-4648029\nto GCs of similar metallicity and find it unlikely that this star has been\ntidally stripped with low ejection velocity from any of the clusters. However,\nboth chemical and kinematic arguments render it plausible that the star has\nbeen ejected at high velocity from the anomalous GC omega Centauri within the\nlast few billion years. We cannot rule out other progenitor GCs, because some\nmay have disrupted fully, and the abundance and orbital data are inadequate for\nmany of those that are still intact.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Tracing interstellar extinction</td>
      <td>Large spectroscopic surveys have enabled in the recent years the computation\nof three-dimensional interstellar extinction maps thanks to accurate stellar\natmospheric parameters and line-of-sight distances. Such maps are complementary\nto 3D maps extracted from photometry, allowing a more thorough study of the\ndust properties. Our goal is to use the high-resolution spectroscopic survey\nGaia-ESO in order to obtain with a good distance resolution the interstellar\nextinction and its dependency as a function of the environment and the\nGalactocentric position. We use the stellar atmospheric parameters of more than\n5000 stars, obtained from the Gaia-ESO survey second internal data release, and\ncombine them with optical (SDSS) and near-infrared (VISTA) photometry as well\nas different sets of theoretical stellar isochrones, in order to calculate\nline-of-sight extinction and distances. The extinction coefficients are then\ncompared with the literature to discuss their dependancy on the stellar\nparameters and position in the Galaxy. Within the errors of our method, our\nwork does not show that there is any dependence of the interstellar extinction\ncoefficient on the atmospheric parameters of the stars. We do not find any\nevidence of the variation of E(J-H)/E(J-K) with the angle from the Galactic\ncentre nor with Galactocentric distance. This suggests that we are dealing with\na uniform extinction law in the SDSS ugriz bands and the near-IR JHKs bands.\nTherefore, extinction maps using mean colour-excesses and assuming a constant\nextinction coefficient can be used without introducing any systematic errors.</td>

[Fe/H] values decrease when using\nthe GES linelist instead of the Arcturus-based linelist; these differences are\nprobably driven by systematically lower (~ -0.1 dex) GES surface gravities.\nUsing the GES linelist we determine abundances for 10 elements - Fe, Mg, Si,\nCa, Ti, Na, Ni, Zr, Ba, and La. We find the cluster's average metallicity\n[Fe/H] = 0.03 +/- 0.07 dex, in good agreement with literature values, and a\nlower [Mg/Fe] abundance than has been reported before for this cluster (0.11\n+/- 0.05 dex).

This method\nrequires full three-dimensional positions and velocities for all stars to be\nfit, but does not require identification of any specific stream or\ndetermination of stream membership for any star. We exploit the principle that\nthe action distribution of stream stars is most clustered when the potential\nused to calculate the actions is closest to the true potential. Clustering is\nquantified with the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), which also provides\nconditional uncertainties for our parameter estimates. We show, for toy\nGaia-like data in a spherical isochrone potential, that maximizing the KLD of\nthe action distribution relative to a smoother distribution recovers the true\nvalues of the potential parameters. The precision depends on the observational\nerrors and the number of streams in the sample; using KIII giants as tracers,\nwe measure the enclosed mass at the average radius of the sample stars accurate\nto 3% and precise to 20-40%. Recovery of the scale radius is precise to 25%,\nand is biased 50% high by the small galactocentric distance range of stars in\nour mock sample (1-25 kpc, or about three scale radii, with mean 6.5 kpc).\nAbout 15 streams, with at least 100 stars per stream, are needed to obtain\nupper and lower bounds on the enclosed mass and scale radius when observational\nerrors are taken into account; 20-25 streams are required to stabilize the size\nof the confidence interval. If radial velocities are provided for stars out to\n100 kpc (10 scale radii), all parameters can be determined with 10% accuracy\nand 20% precision (1.3% accuracy in the case of the enclosed mass), underlining\nthe need for ground-based spectroscopic follow-up to complete the radial\nvelocity catalog for faint halo stars observed by Gaia.</td>

The first catalogue contains stars up to Gaia G 20, while the second\nis the subset containing Gaia radial velocity data with a maximum error of\nsigmaVr=10 kms. Here we present first attempts to characterise the density\nstructure of the Galactic bar in the Gaia space of observables. The Gaia large\nerrors in parallax and the high interstellar extinction in the inner parts of\nthe Galactic disc prevent us to model the bar overdensity. This result suggests\nthe need to combine Gaia and IR data to undertake such studies. We find that IR\nphotometric distances for this Gaia sample allow us to recover the Galactic bar\norientation angle with an accuracy of approximately 5 degrees.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Kinematics of seven Galactic globular clusters</td>
      <td>The Gaia-ESO survey is a large public spectroscopic survey aimed at\ninvestigating the origin and formation history of our Galaxy by collecting\nspectroscopy of representative samples (about 10^5 Milky Way stars) of all\nGalactic stellar populations, in the field and in clusters. The survey uses\nglobular clusters as intra- and inter-survey calibrators, deriving stellar\natmospheric parameters and abundances of a significant number of stars in\nclusters, along with radial velocity determinations. We used precise radial\nvelocities of a large number of stars in seven globular clusters (NGC 1851, NGC\n2808, NGC 4372, NGC 4833, NGC 5927, NGC 6752, and NGC 7078) to validate\npipeline results and to preliminarily investigate the cluster internal\nkinematics. Radial velocity measurements were extracted from FLAMES/GIRAFFE\nspectra processed by the survey pipeline as part of the second internal data\nrelease of data products to ESO. We complemented our sample with ESO archival\ndata obtained with different instrument configurations. Reliable radial\nvelocity measurements for 1513 bona fide cluster star members were obtained in\ntotal. We measured systemic rotation, estimated central velocity dispersions,\nand present velocity dispersion profiles of all the selected clusters,\nproviding the first velocity dispersion curve and the first estimate of the\ncentral velocity dispersion for the cluster NGC~5927. Finally, we explore the\npossible link between cluster kinematics and other physical parameters. The\nanalysis we present here demonstrates that Gaia-ESO survey data are\nsufficiently accurate to be used in studies of kinematics of stellar systems\nand stellar populations in the Milky Way.</td>

      <td>Aim of this work is to determine C, N, and O abundances in stars of Galactic\nopen clusters of the Gaia-ESO survey and to compare the observed abundances\nwith those predicted by current stellar and Galactic evolution models. In this\npilot paper, we investigate the first three intermediate-age open clusters.\nHigh-resolution spectra, observed with the FLAMES-UVES spectrograph on the ESO\nVLT telescope, were analysed using a differential model atmosphere method.\nAbundances of carbon were derived using the C2 band heads at 5135 and 5635.5\n{\AA}. The wavelength interval 6470- 6490 {\AA}, with CN features, was analysed\nto determine nitrogen abundances. Oxygen abundances were determined from the [O\ni] line at 6300 {\AA}. The mean values of the elemental abundances in Trumpler\n20 as determined from 42 stars are: [Fe/H] = 0.10 +- 0.08 (s.d.), [C/H] = -0.10\n+- 0.07, [N/H] = 0.50 +- 0.07, and consequently C/N = 0.98 +- 0.12. We measure\nfrom five giants in NGC 4815: [Fe/H] = -0.01 +- 0.04, [C/H] = -0.17 +- 0.08,\n[N/H] = 0.53 +- 0.07, [O/H] = 0.12 +- 0.09, and C/N = 0.79 +- 0.08. We obtain\nfrom 27 giants in NGC 6705: [Fe/H] = 0.0 +- 0.05, [C/H] = -0.08 +- 0.06, [N/H]\n= 0.61 +- 0.07, [O/H] = 0.13 +- 0.05, and C/N = 0.83 +- 0.19. The C/N ratios of\nstars in the investigated open clusters were compared with the ratios predicted\nby stellar evolutionary models. For the corresponding stellar turn-off masses\nfrom 1.9 to 3.3 solar masses, the observed C/N ratio values are very close to\nthe predictions of standard first dredge-up models as well as to models of\nthermohaline extra-mixing. The average [O/H] abundance ratios of NGC 4815 and\nNGC 6705 are compared with the predictions of two Galactic chemical evolution\nmodels. The data are consistent with the evolution at the solar radius within\nthe errors.</td>

However, clear observational evidence of these\n"dark" substructures remains elusive. Here, we present a detection method based\non the small, but detectable, velocity changes that an orbiting substructure\nimposes on the stars in the MW disk. Using high-resolution numerical\nsimulations we estimate that the new space telescope Gaia should detect the\nkinematic signatures of a few starless substructures provided the CDM paradigm\nholds. Such a measurement will provide unprecedented constraints on the\nprimordial matter power spectrum at low-mass scales and offer a new handle onto\nthe particle physics properties of dark matter.</td>

      <td>We study how diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) measured toward\ndistance-distributed target stars can be used to locate dense interstellar (IS)\nclouds in the Galaxy and probe a line-of-sight (LOS) kinematical structure, a\npotential useful tool when gaseous absorption lines are saturated or not\navailable in the spectral range. Cool target stars are numerous enough for this\npurpose. We have devised automated DIB fitting methods appropriate to cool star\nspectra and multiple IS components. The data is fitted with a combination of a\nsynthetic stellar spectrum, a synthetic telluric transmission, and empirical\nDIB profiles. In parallel, stellar distances and extinctions are estimated\nself-consistently by means of a 2D Bayesian method, from\nspectroscopically-derived stellar parameters and photometric data. We have\nanalyzed Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) and previously recorded spectra that probe\nbetween $\sim$ 2 and 10 kpc long LOS in five different regions of the Milky\nWay. Depending on the observed spectral intervals, we extracted one or more of\nthe following DIBs: $\lambda\lambda$ 6283.8, 6613.6 and 8620.4. For each field,\nwe compared the DIB strengths with the Bayesian distances and extinctions, and\nthe DIB Doppler velocities with the HI emission spectra. For all fields, the\nDIB strength and the target extinction are well correlated. In case of targets\nwidely distributed in distance, marked steps in DIBs and extinction radial\ndistance profiles match with each other and broadly correspond to the expected\nlocations of spiral arms. For all fields, the DIB velocity structure agrees\nwith HI emission spectra and all detected DIBs correspond to strong NaI lines.\nThis illustrates how DIBs can be used to locate the Galactic interstellar gas\nand to study its kinematics at the kpc scale.</td>

      <td>We derive the vertical velocities of disk stars in the range of\nGalactocentric radii of R=5-16 kpc within 2 kpc in height from the Galactic\nplane. This kinematic information is connected to dynamical aspects in the\nformation and evolution of the Milky Way, such as the passage of satellites and\nvertical resonance and determines whether the warp is a long-lived or a\ntransient feature.\n  We used the proper motions of the PPMXL survey, correcting of systematic\nerrors with the reference of quasars. From the color-magnitude diagram K versus\n(J-K) we selected the standard candles corresponding to red clump giants and\nused the information of their proper motions to build a map of the vertical\nmotions of our Galaxy. We derived the kinematics of the warp both analytically\nand through a particle simulation to fit these data. Complementarily, we also\ncarried out the same analysis with red clump giants spectroscopically selected\nwith APOGEE data, and we predict the improvements in accuracy that will be\nreached with future Gaia data.\n  A simple model of warp with the height of the disk z_w(R,phi)=gamma (R-R_sun)\nsin(phi-phi_w) fits the vertical motions if d(gamma)/dt/gamma=-34+/-17\nGyr^{-1}; the contribution to d(gamma)/dt comes from the southern warp and is\nnegligible in the north. The vertical motion in the warp apparently indicates\nthat the main S-shaped structure of the warp is a long-lived feature, whereas\nthe perturbation that produces an irregularity in the southern part is most\nlikely a transient phenomenon. With the use of the Gaia end-of-mission products\ntogether with spectroscopically classified red clump giants, the precision in\nvertical motions can be increased by an order of magnitude at least.</td>

Methods: We simulate the evolution\nof low-metallicity halo stars at distances up to ~ 3 kpc using the binary\npopulation synthesis code SeBa. We use two different white dwarf cooling models\nto predict the present-day luminosities of halo white dwarfs. We determine the\nwhite dwarf luminosity functions (WDLFs) for eight different halo models and\ncompare these with the observed halo WDLF of white dwarfs in the SuperCOSMOS\nSky Survey. Furthermore, we predict the properties of binary white dwarfs in\nthe halo and determine the number of halo white dwarfs that is expected to be\nobserved with the Gaia satellite. Results: By comparing the WDLFs, we find that\na standard IMF matches the observations more accurately than a top-heavy one,\nbut the difference with a bottom-heavy IMF is small. A burst of star formation\n13 Gyr ago fits slightly better than a star formation burst 10 Gyr ago and also\nslightly better than continuous star formation $10-13$ Gyrs ago. Gaia will be\nthe first instrument to constrain the bright end of the field halo WDLF, where\ncontributions from binary WDs are considerable. Many of these will have He\ncores, of which a handful have atypical surface gravities ($\log g < 6$) and\nreach luminosities $\log(L/L_\odot) > 0$ in our standard model for WD cooling.\nThese so called pre-WDs, if observed, can help us to constrain white dwarf\ncooling models and might teach us something about the fraction of halo stars\nthat reside in binaries.</td>

Here we aim at enlarging the volume\nin which individual chemical abundances are used to characterise both discs,\nusing the first internal data release of the Gaia-ESO survey. We derive and\ndiscuss the abundances of eight elements (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Cr, Ni, and\nY). The trends of these elemental abundances with iron are very similar to\nthose in the solar neighbourhood. We find a natural division between alpha-rich\nand alpha-poor stars, best seen in the bimodality of the [Mg/M] distributions\nin bins of metallicity, which we attribute to thick- and thin-disc sequences,\nrespectively. With the possible exception of Al, the observed dispersion around\nthe trends is well described by the expected errors, leaving little room for\nastrophysical dispersion. Using previously derived distances from Recio-Blanco\net al. (2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended vertically\nand is more centrally concentrated towards the inner Galaxy than the thin-disc,\nwhich indicates a shorter scale-length. We derive the radial and vertical\ngradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and Al for the\ntwo populations, taking into account the identified correlation between R_GC\nand |Z|. Radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. The positive\nradial individual [alpha/M] gradients found are at variance from the gradients\nobserved in the RAVE survey. The thin disc also hosts a negative vertical\nmetallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/M] and [Al/M]\ngradients. The thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallower\nvertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-iron\nradial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positive\nvertical individual [alpha/M] and [Al/M] gradients.</td>

At large distances of 20-100 kpc, unbound HVSs are much more common than\nrunaways; radial velocities easily distinguish both from indigenous halo stars.\nComparisons of the predictions with existing observations are encouraging.\nAlthough the models fail to match observations of solar-type HVS candidates\nfrom SEGUE, they agree well with data for B-type HVS and runaways from other\nsurveys. Complete samples of g <= 20 stars with GAIA should provide clear tests\nof formation models for HVSs and runaways and will enable accurate probes of\nthe shape of the Galactic potential.</td>

      <td>(Abridged) We analyzed the stellar parameters and radial velocities of ~1200\nstars in five bulge fields as determined from the Gaia-ESO survey data (iDR1).\nWe use VISTA Variables in The Via Lactea (VVV) photometry to obtain reddening\nvalues by using a semi-empirical T_eff-color calibration. From a Gaussian\ndecomposition of the metallicity distribution functions, we unveil a clear\nbimodality in all fields, with the relative size of components depending of the\nspecific position on the sky. In agreement with some previous studies, we find\na mild gradient along the minor axis (-0.05 dex/deg between b=-6 and b=-10)\nthat arises from the varying proportion of metal-rich and metal-poor\ncomponents. The number of metal-rich stars fades in favor of the metal-poor\nstars with increasing b. The K-magnitude distribution of the metal-rich\npopulation splits into two peaks for two of the analyzed fields that intersects\nthe near and far branches of the X-shaped bulge structure. In addition, two\nlateral fields at (l,b)=(7,-9) and (l,b)=(-10,-8) present contrasting\ncharacteristics. In the former, the metallicity distribution is dominated by\nmetal-rich stars, while in the latter it presents a mix of a metal-poor\npopulation and and a metal-intermediate one, of nearly equal sizes. Finally, we\nfind systematic differences in the velocity dispersion between the metal-rich\nand the metal-poor components of each field. Our chemo-kinematical analysis is\nconsistent with a varying field-to-field proportion of stars belonging to (i) a\nmetal-rich boxy/peanut X-shaped component, with bar-like kinematics, and (ii) a\nmetal-poor more extended rotating structure with a higher velocity dispersion\nthat dominates far from the Galactic plane. These first GES data allow studying\nthe detailed spatial dependence of the Galactic bulge populations, thanks to\nthe analysis of individual fields with relatively high statistics.</td>

      <td>We have adapted our made-to-measure (M2M) algorithm PRIMAL to use mock Milky\nWay like data constructed from an N-body barred galaxy with a boxy bulge in a\nknown dark matter potential. We use M0 giant stars as tracers, with the\nexpected error of the ESA space astrometry mission Gaia. We demonstrate the\nprocess of constructing mock Gaia data from an N-body model, including the\nconversion of a galactocentric Cartesian coordinate N-body model into\nequatorial coordinates and how to add error to it for a single stellar type. We\nthen describe the modifications made to PRIMAL to work with observational\nerror. This paper demonstrates that PRIMAL can recover the radial profiles of\nthe surface density, radial velocity dispersion, vertical velocity dispersion\nand mean rotational velocity of the target disc, along with the pattern speed\nof the bar, to a reasonable degree of accuracy despite the lack of accurate\ntarget data. We also construct mock data which take into account dust\nextinction and show that PRIMAL recovers the structure and kinematics of the\ndisc reasonably well. In other words, the expected accuracy of the Gaia data is\ngood enough for PRIMAL to recover these global properties of the disc, at least\nin a simplified condition, as used in this paper.</td>

      <td>The Gaia inertial reference frame and the tilting of the Milky Way disk</td>
      <td>While the precise relationship between the Milky Way disk and the symmetry\nplanes of the dark matter halo remains somewhat uncertain, a time-varying disk\norientation with respect to an inertial reference frame seems probable.\nHierarchical structure formation models predict that the dark matter halo is\ntriaxial and tumbles with a characteristic rate of ~2 rad/Hubble time (~30\nmuas/yr). These models also predict a time-dependent accretion of gas, such\nthat the angular momentum vector of the disk should be misaligned with that of\nthe halo. These effects, as well as tidal effects of the LMC, will result in\nthe rotation of the angular momentum vector of the disk population with respect\nto the quasar reference frame. We assess the accuracy with which the positions\nand proper motions from Gaia can be referred to a kinematically non-rotating\nsystem, and show that the spin vector of the transformation from any rigid\nself-consistent catalog frame to the quasi-inertial system defined by quasars\nshould be defined to better than 1 muas/yr. Determination of this inertial\nframe by Gaia will reveal any signature of the disk orientation varying with\ntime, improve models of the potential and dynamics of the Milky Way, test\ntheories of gravity, and provide new insights into the orbital evolution of the\nSagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds.</td>

      <td>Characterizing the Galactic warp with Gaia: I. The tilted ring model with a twist</td>
      <td>We explore the possibility of detecting and characterizing the warp of the\nstellar disc of our Galaxy using synthetic Gaia data. The availability of\nproper motions and, for the brightest stars radial velocities, adds a new\ndimension to this study. A family of Great Circle Cell Counts (GC3) methods is\nused. They are ideally suited to find the tilt and twist of a collection of\nrings, which allow us to detect and measure the warp parameters. To test them,\nwe use random realizations of test particles which evolve in a realistic\nGalactic potential warped adiabatically to various final configurations. In\nsome cases a twist is introduced additionally. The Gaia selection function, its\nerrors model and a realistic 3D extinction map are applied to mimic three\ntracer populations: OB, A and Red Clump stars. We show how the use of\nkinematics improves the accuracy in the recovery of the warp parameters. The OB\nstars are demonstrated to be the best tracers determining the tilt angle with\naccuracy better than $\sim0.5$ up to Galactocentric distance of $\sim16$ kpc.\nUsing data with good astrometric quality, the same accuracy is obtained for A\ntype stars up to $\sim13$ kpc and for Red Clump up to the expected stellar\ncut-off. Using OB stars the twist angle is recovered to within $< 3^\circ$ for\nall distances.</td>

Using the\nvariability information afforded by the multi-epoch nature of our XDSS data,\ncombined with colors from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we are able to identify\ncandidate RRLs. We find 318 candidates, derive distances to them and estimate\nthe detection efficiency. The majority of our candidates have more than 12\nobservations and for these we are able to calculate periods. These also allows\nus to estimate our contamination level, which we predict is between 30% to 40%.\nFinally we use the sample to probe the halo density profile in the 9-49 kpc\nrange and find that it can be well fitted by a double power law. We find good\nagreement between this model and the models derived for the South Galactic Cap\nusing the Watkins et al. (2009) and Sesar et al. (2010) RRL data-sets, after\naccounting for possible contamination in our data-set from Sagittarius stream\nmembers. We consider non-spherical double power law models of the halo density\nprofile and again find agreement with literature data-sets, although we have\nlimited power to constrain the flattening due to our small survey area. Much\ntighter constraints will be placed by current and future wide-area surveys,\nmost notably ESA's astrometric Gaia mission. Our analysis demonstrates that\nsurveys with a limited number of epochs can effectively be mined for RRLs. Our\ncomplete sample is provided as accompanying online material.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: radial metallicity gradients and age-metallicity relation of stars in the Milky Way disk</td>
      <td>We study the relationship between age, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement of\nFGK stars in the Galactic disk. The results are based upon the analysis of\nhigh-resolution UVES spectra from the Gaia-ESO large stellar survey. We explore\nthe limitations of the observed dataset, i.e. the accuracy of stellar\nparameters and the selection effects that are caused by the photometric target\npreselection. We find that the colour and magnitude cuts in the survey suppress\nold metal-rich stars and young metal-poor stars. This suppression may be as\nhigh as 97% in some regions of the age-metallicity relationship. The dataset\nconsists of 144 stars with a wide range of ages from 0.5 Gyr to 13.5 Gyr,\nGalactocentric distances from 6 kpc to 9.5 kpc, and vertical distances from the\nplane 0 < |Z| < 1.5 kpc. On this basis, we find that i) the observed\nage-metallicity relation is nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 Gyr and\n8 Gyr; ii) at ages older than 9 Gyr, we see a decrease in [Fe/H] and a clear\nabsence of metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selection\nfunctions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [Fe/H] at any age; and iv)\n[Mg/Fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [Mg/Fe] at ages > 9 Gyr is\nnot as small as advocated by some other studies. In agreement with earlier\nwork, we find that radial abundance gradients change as a function of vertical\ndistance from the plane. The [Mg/Fe] gradient steepens and becomes negative. In\naddition, we show that the inner disk is not only more alpha-rich compared to\nthe outer disk, but also older, as traced independently by the ages and Mg\nabundances of stars.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: the Galactic Thick to Thin Disc transition</td>
      <td>(Abridged) We have used the atmospheric parameters, [alpha/Fe] abundances and\nradial velocities, determined from the Gaia-ESO Survey GIRAFFE spectra of\nFGK-type stars (iDR1), to provide a chemo-kinematical characterisation of the\ndisc stellar populations. We focuss on a subsample of 1016 stars with high\nquality parameters, covering the volume |Z|<4.5kpc and R in the range 2-13kpc.\nWe have identified a thin to thick disc separation in the [alpha/Fe] vs [M/H]\nplane, thanks to the presence of a low-density region in the number density\ndistribution. The thick disc stars seem to lie in progressively thinner layers\nabove the Galactic plane, as metallicity increases and [alpha/Fe] decreases.\nThe thin disc population presents a constant value of the mean distance to the\nplane at all metallicities. Our data confirm the already known correlations\nbetween V_phi and [M/H] for the two discs. For the thick disc sequence, a study\nof the possible contamination by thin disc stars suggests a gradient up to\n64km/s/dex. The distributions of V_phi, V_Z, and orbital parameters are\nanalysed for the chemically separated samples. Concerning the gradients with\ngalactocentric radius, we find for the thin disc a flat behaviour of V_phi, a\n[M/H] gradient of -0.058dex/kpc and a small positive [alpha/Fe] gradient. For\nthe thick disc, flat gradients in [M/H] and [alpha/Fe] are derived. Our\nchemo-kinematical analysis suggests a picture in which the thick disc seems to\nhave experienced a settling process, during which its rotation increased\nprogressively, and, possibly, the V_phi dispersion decreased. At [M/H]-0.25dex\nand [alpha/Fe]0.1dex, the mean characteristics of the thick disc in distance to\nthe Galactic plane, V_phi, V_phi dispersion and eccentricity agree with those\nof the thin disc stars, suggesting a possible connection between these\npopulations at a certain epoch of the disc evolution.</td>

Among\nthem, the very cool white dwarfs provide the information for the early ages of\neach population. Because white dwarfs are intrinsically faint only the nearby\n(about 20 pc) sample is reasonably complete. The Gaia space mission will\ndrastically increase the sample of known white dwarfs through its 5-6 years\nsurvey of the whole sky up to magnitude V = 20-25.\n  Aims. We provide a characterisation of Gaia photometry for white dwarfs to\nbetter prepare for the analysis of the scientific output of the mission.\nTransformations between some of the most common photometric systems and Gaia\npassbands are derived. We also give estimates of the number of white dwarfs of\nthe different galactic populations that will be observed.\n  Methods. Using synthetic spectral energy distributions and the most recent\nGaia transmission curves, we computed colours of three different types of white\ndwarfs (pure hydrogen, pure helium, and mixed composition with H/He= 0.1). With\nthese colours we derived transformations to other common photometric systems\n(Johnson-Cousins, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and 2MASS). We also present numbers\nof white dwarfs predicted to be observed by Gaia.\n  Results. We provide relationships and colour-colour diagrams among different\nphotometric systems to allow the prediction and/or study of the Gaia white\ndwarf colours. We also include estimates of the number of sources expected in\nevery galactic population and with a maximum parallax error. Gaia will increase\nthe sample of known white dwarfs tenfold to about 200 000. Gaia will be able to\nobserve thousands of very cool white dwarfs for the first time, which will\ngreatly improve our understanding of these stars and early phases of star\nformation in our Galaxy.</td>

      <td>Relativistic mergers of compact binaries in clusters: The fingerprint of the spin</td>
      <td>Dense stellar systems such as globular clusters and dense nuclear clusters\nare the breeding ground of sources of gravitational waves for the advanced\ndetectors LIGO and Virgo. These systems deserve a close study to estimate rates\nand parameter distribution. This is not an easy task, since the evolution of a\ndense stellar cluster involves the integration of $N$ bodies with high\nresolution in time and space and including hard binaries and their encounters\nand, in the case of gravitational waves (GWs), one needs to take into account\nimportant relativistic corrections. In this work we present the first\nimplementation of the effect of spin in mergers in a direct-summation code,\nNBODY6. We employ non-spinning post-Newtonian corrections to the Newtonian\naccelerations up to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order as well as the spin-orbit\ncoupling up to next-to-lowest order and the lowest order spin-spin coupling. We\nintegrate spin precession and add a consistent treatment of mergers. We analyse\nthe implementation by running a set of two-body experiments and then we run a\nset of 500 simulations of a relativistic stellar cluster. In spite of the large\nnumber of mergers in our tests, the application of the algorithm is robust. We\nfind in particular the formation of a runaway star whose spin decays with the\nmass it wins, independently of the initial value of the spins of the stars.\nMore remarkably, the subset of compact objects that do not undergo many\nmergers, and hence represent a more realistic system, has a correlation between\nthe final absolute spin and the initial choice for the initial distribution,\nwhich could provide us with information about the evolution of spins in dense\nclusters once the first detections have started.</td>

      <td>The understanding of Galaxy evolution can be facilitated by the use of\npopulation synthesis models, which allows us to test hypotheses on the star\nformation history, star evolution, and chemical and dynamical evolution of the\nGalaxy. The new version of the Besancon Galaxy model (hereafter BGM) aims to\nprovide a more flexible and powerful tool to investigate the initial mass\nfunction (IMF) and star formation rate (SFR) of the Galactic disc. We present a\nnew strategy for the generation of thin disc stars, which assumes the IMF, SFR\nand evolutionary tracks as free parameters. We have updated most of the\ningredients for the star count production and, for the first time, binary stars\nare generated in a consistent way. The local dynamical self-consistency is\nmaintained in this new scheme. We then compare simulations from the new model\nwith Tycho-2 data and the local luminosity function, as a first test to verify\nand constrain the new ingredients. The effects of changing thirteen different\ningredients of the model are systematically studied. For the first time, a full\nsky comparison is performed between BGM and data. This strategy allows us to\nconstrain the IMF slope at high masses, which is found to be close to 3.0 and\nexcludes a shallower slope such as Salpeter's one. The SFR is found decreasing\nwhatever IMF is assumed. The model is compatible with a local dark matter\ndensity of 0.011 Mo/pc^3 implying that there is no compelling evidence for the\nsignificant amount of dark matter in the disc. While the model is fitted to\nTycho-2 data, which is a magnitude limited sample with V<11, we check that it\nis still consistent with fainter stars. The new model constitutes a new basis\nfor further comparisons with large scale surveys and is being prepared to\nbecome a powerful tool for the analysis of the Gaia mission data.</td>

Half of the\nHVSs are fast rotators; they are certain 2.5-4 Msun main sequence stars at 50 -\n120 kpc distances. Correcting for stellar lifetime, our survey implies that\nunbound 2.5-4 Msun stars are ejected from the Milky Way at a rate of 1.5e-6\n/yr. The observed HVSs are likely ejected continuously over the past 200 Myr\nand do not share a common flight time. The anisotropic spatial distribution of\nHVSs on the sky remains puzzling. Southern hemisphere surveys like SkyMapper\nwill soon allow us to map the all-sky distribution of HVSs. Future proper\nmotion measurements with Hubble Space Telescope and Gaia will provide strong\nconstraints on origin.

      <td>Turbovelocity Stars: Kicks Resulting From the Tidal Disruption of Solitary Stars</td>
      <td>The centers of most known galaxies host supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In\norbit around these black holes are a centrally-concentrated distribution of\nstars, both in single and in binary systems. Occasionally, these stars are\nperturbed onto orbits that bring them close to the SMBH. If the star is in a\nbinary system, the three-body interaction with the SMBH can lead to large\nchanges in orbital energy, depositing one of the two stars on a tightly-bound\norbit, and its companion into a hyperbolic orbit that may escape the galaxy. In\nthis Letter, we show that the disruption of solitary stars can also lead to\nlarge positive increases in orbital energy. The kick velocity depends on the\namount of mass the star loses at pericenter, but not on the ratio of black hole\nto stellar mass, and are at most the star's own escape velocity. We find that\nthese kicks are usually too small to result in the ejection of stars from the\nMilky Way, but can eject the stars from the black hole's sphere of influence,\nreducing their probability of being disrupted again. We estimate that ~10^5\nstars, ~1% of all stars within 10 pc of the galactic center, are likely to have\nhad mass removed by the central black hole through tidal interaction, and\nspeculate that these "turbovelocity" stars will at first be redder, but\neventually bluer, and always brighter than their unharrassed peers.</td>

Based on\ncomparisons with mock catalogs, we expect distances for main-sequence stars to\nbe constrained to within ~20% - 60%, although this range can vary, depending on\nthe reddening of the star, the precise stellar type and its position on the\nsky. A further paper will present a 3D map of dust over the three quarters of\nthe sky surveyed by PS1. Both the individual stellar inferences and the 3D dust\nmap will enable a wealth of Galactic science in the plane. The method we\npresent is not limited to the passbands of the PS1 survey, but may be extended\nto incorporate photometry from other surveys, such as 2MASS, SDSS (where\navailable), and in the future, LSST and Gaia.</td>

      <td>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Abundance ratios in the inner-disk open clusters Trumpler 20, NGC 4815, NGC 6705</td>
      <td>Open clusters are key tools to study the spatial distribution of abundances\nin the disk and their evolution with time. Using the first release of stellar\nparameters and abundances of the Gaia-ESO Survey, we analyse the chemical\nproperties of stars in three old/intermediate-age open clusters, namely NGC\n6705, NGC 4815, and Trumpler 20, all located in the inner part of the Galactic\ndisk at Galactocentric radius R$_{GC}\sim$7 kpc, aiming at proving their\nhomogeneity and at comparing them with the field population. We study the\nabundance ratios of elements belonging to two different nucleosynthetic\nchannels: $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements. The main results can be\nsummarised as follows: i) cluster members are chemically homogeneous within\n3-$\sigma$ in all analysed elements; ii) the three clusters have comparable\n[El/Fe] patters within $\sim$1-$\sigma$, but they differ in their global metal\ncontent [El/H], with NGC 4815 having the lowest metallicity. Their [El/Fe]\nratios show differences and analogies with those of the field population, both\nin the solar neighbourhood and in the bulge/inner disk; iii) comparing the\nabundance ratios with the results of two chemical evolution models and with\nfield star abundance distributions, we find that the abundance ratios of Mg,\nNi, Ca in NGC 6705 might require an inner birthplace, implying a subsequent\nvariation of its R$_{GC}$ during its lifetime, consistent with previous orbit\ndetermination. The full dataset of the Gaia-ESO Survey will be a superlative\ntool to constrain the chemical evolution of our Galaxy by disentangling\ndifferent formation and evolution scenarios.</td>

Yet this technique\nto reconstruct dispersed coeval stellar groups has remained largely untested\nuntil recently. We build on previous work that developed an empirical chemical\ntagging probability function, which describes the likelihood that two field\nstars are conatal, that is, they were formed in the same cluster environment.\nIn this work we perform the first ever blind chemical tagging experiment, i.e.,\ntagging stars with no known or otherwise discernable associations, on a sample\nof 714 disc field stars with a number of high quality high resolution\nhomogeneous metal abundance measurements. We present evidence that chemical\ntagging of field stars does identify coeval groups of stars, yet these groups\nmay not represent distinct formation sites, e.g. as in dissolved open clusters,\nas previously thought. Our results point to several important conclusions,\namong them that group finding will be limited strictly to chemical abundance\nspace, e.g. stellar ages, kinematics, colors, temperature and surface gravity\ndo not enhance the detectability of groups. We also demonstrate that in\naddition to its role in probing the chemical enrichment and kinematic history\nof the Galactic disc, chemical tagging represents a powerful new stellar age\ndetermination technique.</td>

      <td>We present and apply rigorous dynamical modeling with which we infer\nunprecedented constraints on the stellar and dark matter mass distribution\nwithin our Milky Way (MW), based on large sets of phase-space data on\nindividual stars. Specifically, we model the dynamics of 16,269 G-type dwarfs\nfrom SEGUE, which sample 5 < R_GC/kpc < 12 and 0.3 < |Z|/kpc < 3. We\nindependently fit a parameterized MW potential and a three-integral,\naction-based distribution function (DF) to the phase-space data of 43 separate\nabundance-selected sub-populations (MAPs), accounting for the complex selection\neffects affecting the data. We robustly measure the total surface density\nwithin 1.1 kpc of the mid-plane to 5% over 4.5 < R_GC/kpc < 9. Using metal-poor\nMAPs with small radial scale lengths as dynamical tracers probes 4.5 < R_GC/kpc\n< 7, while MAPs with longer radial scale lengths sample 7 < R_GC/kpc < 9. We\nmeasure the mass-weighted Galactic disk scale length to be R_d = 2.15+/-0.14\nkpc, in agreement with the photometrically inferred spatial distribution of\nstellar mass. We thereby measure dynamically the mass of the Galactic stellar\ndisk to unprecedented accuracy: M_* = 4.6+/-0.3+3.0x(R_0/kpc-8)x10^{10}Msun and\na total local surface density of \Sigma_{R_0}(Z=1.1 kpc) = 68+/-4 Msun/pc^2 of\nwhich 38+/-4 Msun/pc^2 is contributed by stars and stellar remnants. By\ncombining our surface density measurements with the terminal velocity curve, we\nfind that the MW's disk is maximal in that V_{c,disk} / V_{c,total} =\n0.83+/-0.04 at R=2.2 R_d. We also constrain for the first time the radial\nprofile of the dark halo at such small Galactocentric radii, finding that\n\rho_{DM} (r;near R_0) \propto 1 / r^\alpha with \alpha < 1.53 at 95%\nconfidence.

This in turn will modify correlations between galaxy\npositions and peculiar velocities at late times, since peculiar velocities\nreflect the underlying matter distribution, whereas galaxies are a biased\ntracer of the same. We study this effect, and show that non-Gaussianity can be\nconstrained by comparing the observed peculiar velocity field to a model\nvelocity field reconstructed from the galaxy density field assuming linear\nbias. The amplitude of the spatial correlations in the residual map obtained\nafter subtracting one velocity field from the other is directly proportional to\nthe strength of the primordial non-Gaussianity. We construct the corresponding\nlikelihood function use it to constrain the amplitude of the linear flow\n$\beta$ and the amplitude of local non-Gaussianity $f^{\rm NL}_{\rm local}$.\nApplying our method to two observational data sets, the Type-Ia supernovae\n(A1SN) and Spiral Field \textit{I}-band (SFI++) catalogues, we obtain\nconstraints on the linear flow parameter consistent with the values derived\npreviously assuming Gaussianity. The marginalised 1-D distribution of $|f^{\rm\nNL}_{\rm local}|$ does not show strong evidence for non-zero $f^{\rm NL}_{\rm\nlocal}$, and we set 95% upper limits $|f^{\rm NL}_{\rm local}|<51.4$ from A1SN\nand $|f^{\rm NL}_{\rm local}|<92.6$ from SFI++. These limits on $f^{\rm\nNL}_{\rm local}$ are as tight as any set by previous large-scale structure\nmeasurements. Our method can be applied to any survey with radial velocities\nand density field data, and provides an independent check of recent CMB\nconstraints on $f^{\rm NL}_{\rm local}$, extending these to smaller spatial\nscales.</td>

This "horizon" for full phase-space measurements is\nimposed by the Gaia parallax errors degrading to worse than 10%, and could be\nsignificantly extended by an accurate distance indicator. Recent work has\ndemonstrated how Spitzer observations of RR Lyrae stars can be used to make\ndistance estimates accurate to 2%, effectively extending the Gaia, precise-data\nhorizon by a factor of ten in distance and a factor of 1000 in volume. This\nLetter presents one approach to exploit data of such accuracy to measure the\nGalactic potential using small samples of stars associated with debris from\nsatellite destruction. The method is tested with synthetic observations of 100\nstars from the end point of a simulation of satellite destruction: the shape,\norientation, and depth of the potential used in the simulation are recovered to\nwithin a few percent. The success of this simple test with such a small sample\nin a single debris stream suggests that constraints from multiple streams could\nbe combined to examine the Galaxy's dark matter halo in even more detail --- a\ntruly unique opportunity that is enabled by the combination of Spitzer and Gaia\nwith our intimate perspective on the Galaxy.</td>

      <td>The prospects for using the present-day data on metallicity of globular\nclusters (GCs) of the Galaxy to put constraints on the distance to the Galactic\ncenter, $R_0$, are considered. We have found that the GCs of the metal-rich and\nmetal-poor subsystems separately form a bar-like structure in metallicity maps\nwhose parameters are very close to those for the Galactic bar. The results\nindicate the existence of a bar component within both the metal-rich and\nmetal-poor subsystems of GCs.

We conclude that substantial constraints on the $R_0$ value can be\nobtained only with non-axisymmetric models for the space distribution of GC\nmetallicities with the allowance for the subdivision of GCs into subsystems. We\nfound evidence for a bar extinction component that causes the observational\nincompleteness of GCs in the far side of the Galactic bar and in the\n"post-central" region. This selection effect should be taken into account when\ndetermining $R_0$ from the spatial distribution of GCs.</td>

      <td>Chemodynamical evolution of the Milky Way disk I: The solar vicinity</td>
      <td>[Abridged] In this first paper of this series, we present a new approach for\nstudying the chemo-dynamical evolution in disk galaxies, which consists of\nfusing disk chemical evolution models with compatible numerical simulations of\ngalactic disks. This method avoids known star formation and chemical enrichment\nproblems encountered in simulations. Here we focus on the Milky Way, by using a\ndetailed thin-disk chemical evolution model and a simulation in the\ncosmological context, with dynamical properties close to those of our Galaxy.\nWe show that, due to radial migration from mergers at high redshift and the\ncentral bar at later times, a sizable fraction of old metal-poor\nhigh-[alpha/Fe] stars reaches the solar vicinity. This naturally accounts for a\nnumber of recent observations related to both the thin and thick disks, despite\nthe fact that we use thin-disk chemistry only. Although significant radial\nmixing is present, the slope in the age-metallicity relation is only weakly\naffected, with a scatter compatible with recent observational work. While we\nfind a smooth density distribution in the [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane, we can recover\nthe observed discontinuity by selecting particles according to kinematic\ncriteria used in high-resolution samples to define the thin and thick disks. We\noutline a new method for estimating the birth place of the Sun and predict that\nthe most likely radius lies in the range 4.4 < r < 7.7 kpc (for a location at r\n= 8 kpc). A new, unifying model for the Milky Way thick disk is offered, where\nboth mergers and radial migration play a role at different stages of the disk\nevolution. We show that in the absence of early-on massive mergers the vertical\nvelocity dispersion of the oldest stars is underestimated by a factor of ~2\ncompared with observations. We can, therefore, argue that the Milky Way thick\ndisk is unlikely to have been formed through a quiescent disk evolution.</td>

In\naddition, the spatial distribution of galaxies in small groups is different: at\nthe outskirts of the groups the galaxy number distributions do not agree,\nalthough the agreement is relatively good in the inner regions.

To determine this observationally, it is necessary\nto observe large numbers of extremely metal-poor stars. We present here the\nTurn-Off Primordial Stars survey (TOPoS) that is conducted as an ESO Large\nProgramme at the VLT. This project has {four} main goals: (i) to understand the\nformation of low-mass stars in a low-metallicity gas: determine the metal-weak\ntail of the halo MDF below [M/H]=-3.5. In particular, we aim at determining the\ncritical metallicity, that is the lowest metallicity sufficient for the\nformation of low-mass stars; (ii) to determine the relative abundance of the\nelements in extremely metal-poor stars, which are the signature of the massive\nfirst stars; (iii) to determine the trend of the lithium abundance at the time\nwhen the Galaxy formed; and (iv) to derive the fraction of C-enhanced extremely\nmetal-poor stars with respect to normal extremely metal-poor stars. The large\nnumber of stars observed in the SDSS provides a good sample of candidates of\nstars at extremely low metallicity. Candidates with turn-off colours down to\nmagnitude g=20 were selected from the low-resolution spectra of SDSS by means\nof an automated procedure. X-Shooter has the potential of performing the\nnecessary follow-up spectroscopy, providing accurate metallicities and\nabundance ratios for several key elements for these stars. We here present the\nstellar parameters of the first set of stars. The nineteen stars range in iron\nabundance between -4.1 and -2.9 dex relative to the Sun. Two stars have a high\nradial velocity and, according to our estimate of their kinematics, appear to\nbe marginally bound to the Galaxy and are possibly accreted from another\ngalaxy.</td>

      <td>We analyze high quality abundances data of solar neighborhood stars and show\nthat there are two distinct regimes of [alpha/Fe] versus age which we identify\nas the epochs of the thick and thin disk formation. A tight correlation between\nmetallicity and [alpha/Fe] versus age is clearly identifiable on thick disk\nstars, implying that this population formed from a well mixed ISM, over a time\nscale of 4-5 Gyr. Thick disk stars vertical velocity dispersion correlate with\nage, with the youngest objects having as small scale heights as those of thin\ndisk stars. A natural consequence of these two results is that a vertical\nmetallicity gradient is expected in this population. We suggest that the thick\ndisk set the initial conditions for the formation of the inner thin disk. This\nprovides also an explanation of the apparent coincidence between the step in\nmetallicity at 7-10 kpc in the thin disk and the confinment of the thick disk\nat about R<10 kpc. We suggest that the outer thin disk developped outside the\ninfluence of the thick disk, but also that the high alpha-enrichment of the\nouter regions may originate from a primordial pollution by the gas expelled\nfrom the thick disk. Local metal-poor thin disk stars, whose properties are\nbest explained by an origin in the outer disk, are shown to be as old as the\nyoungest thick disk (9-10 Gyr), implying that the outer thin disk started to\nform while the thick disk formation was still on-going in the inner Galaxy. We\npoint out that, given the tight age-abundance relations in the thick disk, an\ninside-out process would give rise to a radial gradient in abundances in this\npopulation which is not observed. Finally, we argue that the data discussed\nhere leave little room for radial migration, either to have contaminated the\nsolar vicinity, or, to have redistributed stars in significant proportion\nacross the solar annulus.</td>

      <td>Toward a hybrid dynamo model for the Milky Way</td>
      <td>(Abridged) Based on the rapidly increasing all-sky data of Faraday rotation\nmeasures and polarised synchrotron radiation, the Milky Way's magnetic field is\nnow modelled with an unprecedented level of detail and complexity. We aim to\ncomplement this heuristic approach with a physically motivated, quantitative\nGalactic dynamo model -- a model that moreover allows for the evolution of the\nsystem as a whole, instead of just solving the induction equation for a fixed\nstatic disc. Building on the framework of mean-field magnetohydrodynamics and\nextending it to the realm of a hybrid evolution, we perform three-dimensional\nglobal simulations of the Galactic disc. Closure coefficients embodying the\nmean-field dynamo are calibrated against resolved box simulations of\nsupernova-driven interstellar turbulence. The emerging dynamo solutions\ncomprise a mixture of the dominant axisymmetric S0 mode, with even parity, and\na subdominant A0 mode, with odd parity. Notably, such a superposition of modes\ncreates a strong localised vertical field on one side of the Galactic disc. We\nmoreover find significant radial pitch angles, which decay with radius --\nexplained by flaring of the disc. In accordance with previous work, magnetic\ninstabilities appear to be restricted to the less-stirred outer Galactic disc.\nTheir main effect is to create strong fields at large radii such that the\nradial scale length of the magnetic field increases from 4 kpc (for the case of\na mean-field dynamo alone) to about 10 kpc in the hybrid models. There remain\naspects (e.g., spiral arms, X-shaped halo fields, fluctuating fields) that are\nnot captured by the current model and that will require further development\ntowards a fully dynamical evolution. Nevertheless, the work presented\ndemonstrates that a hybrid modelling of the Galactic dynamo is feasible and can\nserve as a foundation for future efforts.</td>

      <td>Two distinct red giant branch populations in the globular cluster NGC 2419 as tracers of a merger event in the Milky Way</td>
      <td>Recent spectroscopic observations of the outer halo globular cluster (GC) NGC\n2419 show that it is unique among GCs, in terms of chemical abundance patterns,\nand some suggest that it was originated in the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy. Here\nwe show, from the Subaru narrow-band photometry employing a calcium filter,\nthat the red giant-branch (RGB) of this GC is split into two distinct\nsubpopulations. Comparison with spectroscopy has confirmed that the redder RGB\nstars in the $hk$[=(Ca$-b)-(b-y)$] index are enhanced in [Ca/H] by $\sim$0.2\ndex compared to the bluer RGB stars. Our population model further indicates\nthat the calcium-rich second generation stars are also enhanced in helium\nabundance by a large amount ($\Delta$Y = 0.19). Our photometry, together with\nthe results for other massive GCs (e.g., $\omega$ Cen, M22, and NGC 1851),\nsuggests that the discrete distribution of RGB stars in the $hk$ index might be\na universal characteristic of this growing group of peculiar GCs. The planned\nnarrow-band calcium photometry for the Local Group dwarf galaxies would help to\nestablish an empirical connection between these GCs and the primordial building\nblocks in the hierarchical merging paradigm of galaxy formation.</td>

      <td>By selecting in the RAVE-DR4 survey the stars located between 1 and 2 kpc\nabove the Galactic plane, we question the consistency of the simplest\nthree-component model (thin disc, thick disc, halo) for the Milky Way. We\nconfirm that the metallicity and azimuthal velocity distribution functions of\nthe thick disc are not Gaussian. In particular, we find that the thick disc has\nan extended metallicity tail going at least down to [M/H]=-2 dex, contributing\nroughly at 3% of the entire thick disc population and having a shorter\nscale-length compared to the canonical thick disc. The mean azimuthal velocity\nof these metal-poor stars allows us to estimate the correlation between the\nmetallicity and the orbital velocity, which is an important constraint on the\nformation mechanisms of the Galactic thick disc. Given our simple approach, we\nfind dVphi/d[M/H] ~ 50 km/s/dex, which is in a very good agreement with\nprevious literature values. We complete the study with a brief discussion on\nthe implications of the formation scenarios for the thick disc, and suggest\nthat given the above mentioned characteristics, a thick disc mainly formed by\nradial migration mechanisms seems unlikely.</td>

      <td>Aim: We aim at measuring the chemical gradients of the elements Mg, Al, Si,\nand Fe along the Galactic radius to provide new constraints on the chemical\nevolution models of the Galaxy and Galaxy models such as the Besancon model.\n  Methods: We analysed three different samples selected from three independent\ndatasets: a sample of 19,962 dwarf stars selected from the RAVE database, a\nsample of 10,616 dwarf stars selected from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS)\ndataset, and a mock sample (equivalent to the RAVE sample) created by using the\nGALAXIA code, which is based on the Besancon model. We measured the chemical\ngradients as functions of the guiding radius (Rg) at different distances from\nthe Galactic plane reached by the stars along their orbit (Zmax).\n  Results: The chemical gradients of the RAVE and GCS samples are negative and\nshow consistent trends, although they are not equal: at Zmax<0.4 kpc and\n4.5<Rg(kpc)<9.5, the iron gradient for the RAVE sample is d[Fe/H]/dRg=-0.065\ndex kpc^{-1}, whereas for the GCS sample it is d[Fe/H]/dRg=-0.043 dex kpc^{-1}\nwith internal errors +-0.002 and +-0.004 dex kpc^{-1}, respectively. The\ngradients of the RAVE and GCS samples become flatter at larger Zmax.\nConversely, the mock sample has a positive iron gradient of\nd[Fe/H]/dRg=+0.053+-0.003 dex kpc^{-1} at Zmax<0.4 kpc and remains positive at\nany Zmax. These positive and unrealistic values originate from the lack of\ncorrelation between metallicity and tangential velocity in the Besancon model.\nThe discrepancies between the observational samples and the mock sample can be\nreduced by i) decreasing the density, ii) decreasing the vertical velocity, and\niii) increasing the metallicity of the thick disc in the Besancon model.</td>

In\nanalyses of galaxy overdensities and weak lensing shear, one often approximates\nthe likelihood of the power spectrum with a Gaussian distribution. The\nposterior probability derived from such a likelihood deviates considerably from\nthe exact posterior on the largest scales probed by any survey, where the\ncentral limit theorem does not apply. We show that various forms of Gaussian\nlikelihoods can have a significant impact on the estimation of the primordial\nnon-Gaussianity parameter f_NL from the galaxy angular power spectrum. The\nGaussian plus log-normal likelihood, which has been applied successfully in\nanalyses of the cosmic microwave background, outperforms the Gaussian\nlikelihoods. Nevertheless, even if the exact likelihood of the power spectrum\nis used, the estimated parameters may be still biased. As such, the likelihoods\nand estimators need to be thoroughly examined for potential systematic errors.</td>

We detected the black hole candidate, which we term\nM62-VLA1, in the core of the cluster using deep radio continuum imaging from\nthe Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. M62-VLA1 is a faint source, with a flux\ndensity of 18.7 +/- 1.9 microJy at 6.2 GHz and a flat radio spectrum\n(alpha=-0.24 +/- 0.42, for S_nu = nu^alpha). M62 is the second Milky Way\ncluster with a candidate stellar-mass black hole; unlike the two candidate\nblack holes previously found in the cluster M22, M62-VLA1 is associated with a\nChandra X-ray source, supporting its identification as a black hole X-ray\nbinary. Measurements of its radio and X-ray luminosity, while not simultaneous,\nplace M62-VLA1 squarely on the well-established radio--X-ray correlation for\nstellar-mass black holes. In archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging, M62-VLA1\nis coincident with a star near the lower red giant branch. This possible\noptical counterpart shows a blue excess, H alpha emission, and optical\nvariability. The radio, X-ray, and optical properties of M62-VLA1 are very\nsimilar to those for V404 Cyg, one of the best-studied quiescent stellar-mass\nblack holes. We cannot yet rule out alternative scenarios for the radio source,\nsuch as a flaring neutron star or background galaxy; future observations are\nnecessary to determine whether M62-VLA1 is indeed an accreting stellar-mass\nblack hole.</td>

      <td>Solar abundance of manganese: a case for the existence of near Chandrasekhar-mass Type Ia supernova progenitors</td>
      <td>Context: Manganese is predominantly synthesised in Type Ia supernova (SN Ia)\nexplosions. Owing to the entropy dependence of the Mn yield in explosive\nthermonuclear burning, SNe Ia involving near Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs\n(WDs) are predicted to produce Mn to Fe ratios significantly exceeding those of\nSN Ia explosions involving sub-Chandrasekhar mass primary WDs. Of all current\nsupernova explosion models, only SN Ia models involving near-Chandrasekhar mass\nWDs produce [Mn/Fe] > 0.0. Aims: Using the specific yields for competing SN Ia\nscenarios, we aim to constrain the relative fractions of exploding\nnear-Chandrasekhar mass to sub-Chandrasekhar mass primary WDs in the Galaxy.\nMethods: We extract the Mn yields from three-dimensional thermonuclear\nsupernova simulations referring to different initial setups and progenitor\nchannels. We then compute the chemical evolution of Mn in the Solar\nneighborhood, assuming SNe Ia are made up of different relative fractions of\nthe considered explosion models. Results: We find that due to the entropy\ndependence of freeze-out yields from nuclear statistical equilibrium, [Mn/Fe]\nstrongly depends on the mass of the exploding WD, with near-Chandraskher mass\nWDs producing substantially higher [Mn/Fe] than sub-Chandrasekhar mass WDs. Of\nall nucleosynthetic sources potentially influencing the chemical evolution of\nMn, only explosion models involving the thermonuclear incineration of\nnear-Chandrasekhar mass WDs predict solar or super-solar [Mn/Fe]. Consequently,\nwe find in our chemical evolution calculations that the observed [Mn/Fe] in the\nSolar neighborhood at [Fe/H] > 0.0 cannot be reproduced without\nnear-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia primaries. Assuming that 50 per cent of all SNe\nIa stem from explosive thermonuclear burning in near-Chandrasekhar mass WDs\nresults in a good match to data.</td>

      <td>We created artificial color-magnitude diagrams of Monte Carlo dynamical\nmodels of globular clusters, and then used observational methods to determine\nthe number of blue stragglers in those clusters. We compared these blue\nstragglers to various cluster properties, mimicking work that has been done for\nblue stragglers in Milky Way globular clusters to determine the dominant\nformation mechanism(s) of this unusual stellar population. We find that a\nmass-based prescription for selecting blue stragglers will choose approximately\ntwice as many blue stragglers than a selection criterion that was developed for\nobservations of real clusters. However, the two numbers of blue stragglers are\nwell-correlated, so either selection criterion can be used to characterize the\nblue straggler population of a cluster. We confirm previous results that the\nsimplified prescription for the evolution of a collision or merger product in\nthe BSE code overestimates their lifetimes. We show that our model blue\nstragglers follow similar trends with cluster properties (core mass, binary\nfraction, total mass, collision rate) as the true Milky Way blue stragglers, as\nlong as we restrict ourselves to model clusters with an initial binary fraction\nhigher than 5%. We also show that, in contrast to earlier work, the number of\nblue stragglers in the cluster core does have a weak dependence on the\ncollisional parameter Gamma in both our models and in Milky Way globular\nclusters.</td>

      <td>The Chemical Evolution of the Milky Way: the Three Infall Model</td>
      <td>We present a new chemical evolution model for the Galaxy that assumes three\nmain infall episodes of primordial gas for the formation of halo, thick and\nthin disk, respectively. We compare our results with selected data taking into\naccount NLTE effects. The most important parameters of the model are (i) the\ntimescale for gas accretion, (ii) the efficiency of star formation and (iii) a\nthreshold in the gas density for the star formation process, for each Galactic\ncomponent. We find that, in order to best fit the features of the solar\nneighbourhood, the halo and thick disk must form on short timescales (~0.2 and\n~1.25 Gyr, respectively), while a longer timescale is required for the\nthin-disk formation. The efficiency of star formation must be maximum (10\nGyr-1) during the thick-disk phase and minimum (1 Gyr-1) during the thin-disk\nformation. Also the threshold gas density for star formation is suggested to be\ndifferent in the three Galactic components. Our main conclusion is that in the\nframework of our model an independent episode of accretion of extragalactic\ngas, which gives rise to a burst of star formation, is fundamental to explain\nthe formation of the thick disk. We discuss our results in comparison to\nprevious studies and in the framework of modern galaxy formation theories.</td>

      <td>The Bifurcated Age-Metallicity Relation of Milky Way Globular Clusters and its Implications For the Accretion History of the Galaxy</td>
      <td>We use recently derived ages for 61 Milky Way (MW) globular clusters (GCs) to\nshow that their age-metallicity relation (AMR) can be divided into two\ndistinct, parallel sequences at [Fe/H] $\ga -1.8$. Approximately one-third of\nthe clusters form an offset sequence that spans the full range in age ($\sim\n10.5$--13 Gyr), but is more metal rich at a given age by $\sim 0.6$ dex in\n[Fe/H]. All but one of the clusters in the offset sequence show orbital\nproperties that are consistent with membership in the MW disk. They are not\nsimply the most metal-rich GCs, which have long been known to have disk-like\nkinematics, but they are the most metal-rich clusters at all ages. The slope of\nthe mass-metallicity relation (MMR) for galaxies implies that the offset in\nmetallicity of the two branches of the AMR corresponds to a mass decrement of 2\ndex, suggesting host galaxy masses of $M_{*} \sim 10^{7-8} \msol$ for GCs that\nbelong to the more metal-poor AMR. We suggest that the metal-rich branch of the\nAMR consists of clusters that formed in-situ in the disk, while the metal-poor\nGCs were formed in relatively low-mass (dwarf) galaxies and later accreted by\nthe MW. The observed AMR of MW disk stars, and of the LMC, SMC and WLM dwarf\ngalaxies are shown to be consistent with this interpretation, and the relative\ndistribution of implied progenitor masses for the halo GC clusters is in\nexcellent agreement with the MW subhalo mass function predicted by simulations.\nA notable implication of the bifurcated AMR, is that the identical mean ages\nand spread in ages, for the metal rich and metal poor GCs are difficult to\nreconcile with an in-situ formation for the latter population.</td>

      <td>The expansion of massive young star clusters - observation meets theory</td>
      <td>Most stars form as part of a star cluster. The most massive clusters in the\nMilky Way exist in two groups - loose and compact clusters - with significantly\ndifferent sizes at the end of the star formation process. After their formation\nboth types of clusters expand up to a factor 10-20 within the first 20 Myr. Gas\nexpulsion at the end of the star formation process is usually regarded as only\npossible process that can lead to such an expansion.We investigate the effect\nof gas expulsion by a direct comparison between numerical models and observed\nclusters concentrating on clusters with masses >10^3 M(sun). For these clusters\nthe initial conditions before gas expulsion, the characteristic cluster\ndevelopment, its dependence on cluster mass, and the star formation efficiency\n(SFE) are investigated. We perform N-body simulations of the cluster expansion\nprocess after gas expulsion and compare the results with observations. We find\nthat the expansion processes of the observed loose and compact massive clusters\nare driven by completely different physical processes. As expected the\nexpansion of loose massive clusters is largely driven by the gas loss due to\nthe low SFE of ~30%. One new revelation is that all the observed massive\nclusters of this group seem to have a very similar size of 1-3 pc at the onset\nof expansion. It is demonstrated that compact clusters have a much higher\neffective SFE of 60-70% and are as a result much less affected by gas\nexpulsion. Their expansion is mainly driven by stellar ejections caused by\ninteractions between the cluster members. The reason why ejections are so\nefficient in driving cluster expansion is that they occur dominantly from the\ncluster centre and over an extended period of time. Thus during the first 10\nMyr the internal dynamics of loose and compact clusters differ fundamentally.</td>

      <td>The Origin of HVS17, an Unbound Main Sequence B Star at 50 kpc</td>
      <td>We analyze Keck ESI spectroscopy of HVS17, a B-type star traveling with a\nGalactic rest frame radial velocity of +445 km/s in the outer halo of the Milky\nWay. HVS17 has the projected rotation of a main sequence B star and is\nchemically peculiar, with solar iron abundance and sub-solar alpha abundance.\nComparing measured T_eff and logg with stellar evolution tracks implies that\nHVS17 is a 3.91 +-0.09 Msun, 153 +-9 Myr old star at a Galactocentric distance\nof r=48.5 +-4.6 kpc. The time between its formation and ejection significantly\nexceeds 10 Myr and thus is difficult to reconcile with any Galactic disk\nrunaway scenario involving massive stars. The observations are consistent, on\nthe other hand, with a hypervelocity star ejection from the Galactic center. We\nshow that Gaia proper motion measurements will easily discriminate between a\ndisk and Galactic center origin, thus allowing us to use HVS17 as a test\nparticle to probe the shape of the Milky Way's dark matter halo.</td>

      <td>Quantifying mass segregation and new core radii for 54 milky way globular clusters</td>
      <td>We present core radii for 54 Milky Way globular clusters determined by\nfitting King-Michie models to cumulative projected star count distributions. We\nfind that fitting star counts rather than surface brightness profiles produces\nresults that differ significantly due to the presence of mass segregation. The\nsample in each cluster is further broken down into various mass groups, each of\nwhich is fit independently, allowing us to determine how the concentration of\neach cluster varies with mass. The majority of the clusters in our sample show\ngeneral agreement with the standard picture that more massive stars will be\nmore centrally concentrated. We find that core radius vs. stellar mass can be\nfit with a two parameter power-law. The slope of this power-law is a value that\ndescribes the amount of mass segregation present in the cluster, and is\nmeasured independently of our distance from the cluster. This value correlates\nstrongly with the core relaxation time and physical size of each cluster.\nSupplementary figures are also included showing the best fits and likelihood\ncontours of fit parameters for all 54 clusters.</td>

      <td>Galactic abundance gradients from Cepheids: alpha and heavy elements in the outer disk</td>
      <td>Context: Galactic abundance gradients set strong constraints to\nchemo-dynamical evolutionary models of the Milky Way. Given the PL relations\nthat provide accurate distances and the large number of spectral lines,\nCepheids are excellent tracers of the present-day abundance gradients. Aims: We\nwant to measure the Galactic abundance gradient of several chemical elements.\nWhile the slope of the Cepheid iron gradient did not vary much from the very\nfirst studies, the gradients of the other elements are not that well\nconstrained. In this paper we focus on the inner and outer regions of the\nGalactic thin disk. Methods: We use HR spectra (FEROS, ESPADONS, NARVAL) to\nmeasure the abundances of several light (Na, Al), alpha (Mg, Si, S, Ca), and\nheavy elements (Y, Zr, La, Ce, Nd, Eu) in a sample of 65 Milky Way Cepheids.\nCombining these results with accurate distances from period-Wesenheit relations\nin the NIR enables us to determine the abundance gradients in the Milky Way.\nResults: Our results are in good agreement with previous studies on either\nCepheids or other tracers. In particular, we confirm an upward shift of\napproximatively 0.2 dex for the Mg abundances, as has recently been reported.\nWe also confirm the existence of a gradient for all the heavy elements studied\nin the context of a LTE analysis. However, for Y, Nd, and especially La, we\nfind lower abundances for Cepheids in the outer disk than reported in previous\nstudies, leading to steeper gradients. This effect can be explained by the\ndifferences in the line lists used by different groups. Conclusions: Our data\ndo not support a flattening of the gradients in the outer disk, in agreement\nwith recent Cepheid studies and chemo-dynamical simulations. This is in\ncontrast to the open cluster observations but remains compatible with a picture\nwhere the transition zone between the inner disk and the outer disk would move\noutward with time.</td>

      <td>A Galactic Ring of Minimum Stellar Density Near the Solar Orbit Radius</td>
      <td>We analyse the secular effects of a long-lived Galactic spiral structure on\nthe stellar orbits with mean radii close to the corotation resonance. By\ntest-particle simulations and different spiral potential models with parameters\nconstrained on observations, we verified the formation of a minimum with\namplitude ~ 30% - 40% of the background disk stellar density at corotation.\nSuch minimum is formed by the secular angular momentum transfer between stars\nand the spiral density wave on both sides of corotation. We demonstrate that\nthe secular loss (gain) of angular momentum and decrease (increase) of mean\norbital radius of stars just inside (outside) corotation can counterbalance the\nopposite trend of exchange of angular momentum shown by stars orbiting the\nlibrational points L_4/5 at the corotation circle. Such secular processes\nactually allow steady spiral waves to promote radial migration across\ncorotation. We propose some observational evidences for the minimum stellar\ndensity in the Galactic disk, such as its direct relation to the minimum in the\nobserved rotation curve of the Galaxy at the radius R ~ 9 kpc (for R_0 = 7.5\nkpc), as well as its association with a minimum in the distribution of Galactic\nradii of a sample of open clusters older than 1 Gyr. The closeness of the solar\norbit radius to the corotation resonance implies that the solar orbit lies\ninside a ring of minimum surface density (stellar + gas). This also implies in\na correction to larger values for the estimated total mass of the Galactic\ndisk, and consequently, a greater contribution of the disk component to the\ninner rotation curve of the Galaxy.</td>

We find no evidence\nfor an X-ray point source near any of the cluster's proposed dynamical centers,\nand place an upper limit on the X-ray flux from a central source of f_X(0.5-7.0\nkeV) <= 5.0x10^-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1, after correcting for absorption. This\ncorresponds to an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of L_X(0.5-7.0 keV) <= 1.6x10^30\nerg s^-1, for a cluster distance of 5.2 kpc, Galactic column density N_H =\n1.2x10^21 cm^-2, and powerlaw spectrum with Gamma = 2.3. If a ~10^4 M_sun IMBH\nresides in the cluster's core, as suggested by some stellar dynamical studies,\nits Eddington luminosity would be L_Edd ~10^42 erg s^-1. The new X-ray limit\nwould then establish an Eddington ratio of L_X/L_Edd <~ 10^-12, a factor of ~10\nlower than even the quiescent state of our Galaxy's notoriously inefficient\nsupermassive black hole Sgr A*, and imply accretion efficiencies as low as eta\n<~ 10^-6 - 10^-8.

      <td>We present a new method to estimate the fraction of stars with chemical\ncomposition of first and second(s) generation(s) currently hosted in Galactic\nglobular clusters (GCs). We compare cluster and field stars of similar\nmetallicity in the [Fe/H]-[Na/H] plane. Since the phenomenon of multiple\npopulations is only restricted to the cluster environment, the number of GC\nstars whose location coincides with that of field stars provides the fraction\nof first generation stars in that cluster. By exclusion, the fraction of second\ngeneration stars is derived. We assembled a dataset of 1891 field stars of the\nthin disk, thick disk, and halo of the Milky Way in the metallicity range -3.15\n<= [Fe/H] <= +0.48 dex and with Na abundance from high resolution spectra. They\nare mostly dwarfs, but include also giants. Considering only the range in\nmetallicity spanned by most GCs extensively studied for the Na-O\nanticorrelation (-2.36 <= [Fe/H] <= -0.33 dex), we have 804 stars. The total\nsample is homogeneized by offsets in [Fe/H] and [Na/H] with respect to a\nreference sample using the same line list and NLTE correction for Na adopted in\na recent extensive survey of GC stars. This fully accounts for offsets among\nanalyses due to different temperature scales, line lists, adopted (or\nneglected) corrections for departures from LTE. We illustrate our method\nestimating the fraction of first and second generation stars in the well\nstudied GC NGC 6752. As a by-product, the comparison of [Na/H] values in GC and\nfield stars suggests that at least two classes of old stellar systems probably\ncontributed to the halo assembly: one group with characteristics similar to the\ncurrently existing GCs, and the other more similar to the present-day dwarf\nsatellite galaxies.</td>

      <td>A Mass-Dependent Yield Origin of Neutron-Capture Element Abundance Distributions in Ultra-Faint Dwarfs</td>
      <td>One way to constrain the nature of the high-redshift progenitors of the Milky\nWay is to look at the low-metallicity stellar populations of the different\nGalactic components today. For example, high-resolution spectroscopy of very\nmetal poor (VMP) stars demonstrates remarkable agreement between the\ndistribution of [Ti/Fe] in the stellar populations of the Milky Way halo (MW)\nand ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies. In contrast, for the neutron capture (nc)\nabundance ratio distributions [(Sr,Ba)/Fe], the peak of the small UFD sample (6\nstars) exhibits a signicant under-abundance relative to the VMP stars in the\nlarger MW halo sample (~ 300 stars). We present a simple scenario that can\nsimultaneously explain these similarities and differences by assuming: (i) that\nthe MW VMP stars were predominately enriched by a prior generation of stars\nwhich possessed a higher total mass than the prior generation of stars that\nenriched the UFD VMP stars; and (ii) a much stronger mass-dependent yield (MDY)\nfor nc-elements than for the (known) MDY for Ti. Simple statistical tests\ndemonstrate that conditions (i) and (ii) are consistent with the observed\nabundance distributions, albeit without strong constraints on model parameters.\nA comparison of the broad constraints for these nc-MDY with those derived in\nthe literature seems to rule out Ba production from low-mass SNs and affirms\nmodels that primarily generate yields from high-mass SN. Our scenario can be\nconfirmed by a relatively modest (factor of ~ 3-4) increase in the number of\nhigh-resolution spectra of VMP stars in UFDs.</td>

      <td>Towards a photometric metallicity scale for open clusters</td>
      <td>Open clusters are a useful tool when investigating several topics connected\nwith stellar evolution; for example the age or distance can be more accurately\ndetermined than for field stars. However, one important parameter, the\nmetallicity, is only known for a marginal percentage of open clusters. We aim\nat a consistent set of parameters for the open clusters investigated in our\nphotometric Delta-a survey of chemically peculiar stars. Special attention is\npaid to expanding our knowledge of cluster metallicities and verifying their\nscale. Making use of a previously developed method based on normalised\nevolutionary grids and photometric data, the distance, age, reddening, and\nmetallicity of open clusters were derived. To transform photometric\nmeasurements into effective temperatures to use as input for our method, a set\nof temperature calibrations for the most commonly used colour indices and\nphotometric systems was compiled. We analysed 58 open clusters in total. Our\nderived metallicity values were in excellent agreement with about 30\nspectroscopically studied targets. The mean value of the absolute deviations\nwas found to be 0.03 dex, with no noticeable offset or gradient. The method was\nalso applied using recent evolutionary models based on the currently accepted\nlower solar abundance value Z=0.014. No significant differences were found\ncompared to grids using the former adopted solar value Z=0.02. Furthermore,\nsome divergent photometric datasets were identified and discussed. The method\nprovides an accurate way of obtaining properly scaled metallicity values for\nopen clusters. In light of present and future homogeneous photometric sky\nsurveys, the sample of stellar clusters can be extended to the outskirts of the\nMilky Way, where spectroscopic studies are almost impossible. This will help\nfor determining galactic metallicity gradients in more detail.</td>

      <td>Stars on the run: escaping from stellar clusters</td>
      <td>A significant proportion of Milky Way stars are born in stellar clusters,\nwhich dissolve over time so that the members become part of the disc and halo\npopulations of the Galaxy. In the present work we will assume that these young\nstellar clusters live mainly within the disc of the Galaxy and that they can\nhave primordial binary percentages ranging from 0% to as high as 70%. We have\nevolved models of such clusters to an age of 4 Gyr through N-body simulations,\npaying attention to the stars and binaries that escape in the process. We have\nquantified the contribution of these escaping stars to the Galaxy population by\nanalysing their escape velocity and evolutionary stage at the moment of escape.\nIn this way we could analyse the mechanisms that produced these escapers,\nwhether evaporation through weak two- body encounters, energetic close\nencounters or stellar evolution events, e.g. supernovae. In our models we found\nthat the percentage of primordial binaries in a star cluster does not produce\nsignificant variations in the velocities of the stars that escape in the\nvelocity range of 0-20 km/s. However, in the high-velocity 20-100 km/s range\nthe number of escapers increased markedly as the primordial binary percentage\nincreased. We could also infer that dissolving stellar clusters such as those\nthat we have modelled can populate the Galactic halo with giant stars for which\nthe progenitors were stars of up to 2.4 Msun. Furthermore, choices made for the\nvelocity kicks of remnants do influence the production of hyper-velocity stars\n- and to a lesser extent stars in the high-velocity range - but once again the\ndifference for the 99% of stars in the 0-20 km/s range is not significant.</td>

      <td>Constraining the Galactic potential via action-based distribution functions for mono-abundance stellar populations</td>
      <td>We present a rigorous and practical way of constraining the Galactic\npotential based on the phase-space information for many individual stars. Such\nan approach is needed to dynamically model the data from ongoing spectroscopic\nsurveys of the Galaxy and in the future Gaia. This approach describes the orbit\ndistribution of stars by a family of parametrized distribution function (DF)\nproposed by McMillan and Binney, which are based on actions. We find that these\nparametrized DFs are flexible enough to capture well the observed phase-space\ndistributions of individual abundance-selected Galactic subpopulations of stars\n(`mono-abundance populations') for a disc-like gravitational potential, which\nenables independent dynamical constraints from each of the Galactic\nmono-abundance populations. We lay out a statistically rigorous way to\nconstrain the Galactic potential parameters by constructing the joint\nlikelihood of potential and DF parameters, and subsequently marginalizing over\nthe DF parameters. This approach explicitly incorporates the spatial selection\nfunction inherent to all Galactic surveys, and can account for the\nuncertainties of the individual position--velocity observations. On that basis,\nwe study the precision of the parameters of the Galactic potential that can be\nreached with various sample sizes and realistic spatial selection functions. By\ncreating mock samples from the DF, we show that, even under a restrictive and\nrealistic spatial selection function, given a two-parameter gravitational\npotential, one can recover the true potential parameters to a few per cent with\nsample sizes of a few thousands. The assumptions of axisymmetry, of DFs that\nare smooth in the actions and of no time variation remain important limitations\nin our current study.</td>

The ULX is spectrally hard in X-rays\n(Gamma ~ 1.2-1.7, when fitted with an absorbed power-law), and has a\npreviously-reported hard spectral break consistent with it being in the\nultraluminous accretion state. It is also relatively highly absorbed for a ULX,\nwith a column of ~ 0.4-0.9x10^{22} atom cm^{-2} in addition to the\nline-of-sight column in our Galaxy. Although its X-ray spectra are well\nrepresented by accretion disc models, its variability characteristics argue\nagainst this interpretation. The ULX spectra instead appear dominated by a\ncool, optically-thick Comptonising corona. We discuss how the measured 9 per\ncent rms variability and a hardening of the spectrum as its flux diminishes\nmight be reconciled with the effects of a very massive, radiatively-driven\nwind, and subtle changes in the corona respectively. We speculate that the cool\ndisc-like spectral component thought to be produced by the wind in other ULXs\nmay be missing from the observed spectrum due to a combination of a low\ntemperature (~ 0.1 keV), and the high column to the ULX. We find no evidence,\nother than its extreme X-ray luminosity, for the presence of an intermediate\nmass black hole (~ 10^2 - 10^4 Msun) in this object. Rather, the observations\ncan be consistently explained by a massive (greater than ~ 20 Msun) stellar\nremnant black hole in a super-Eddington accretion state.</td>

      <td>A link between feedback outflows and satellite galaxy suppression</td>
      <td>We suggest a direct link between the two "missing" baryon problems of\ncontemporary galaxy formation theory: (1) that large galaxies are known to\ncontain too little gas and stars and (2) that too few dwarf satellite galaxies\nare observed around large galaxies compared with cosmological simulations. The\nformer can be explained by invoking some energetic process -- most likely AGN\nor star formation feedback -- which expels to infinity a significant fraction\nof the gas initially present in the proto-galaxy, while the latter problem is\nusually explained by star formation feedback inside the dwarf or tidal and ram\npressure stripping of the gas from the satellite galaxy by its parent. Here we\npoint out that the host galaxy "missing" baryons, if indeed ejected at\nvelocities of hundreds to a thousand km s$^{-1}$, must also affect smaller\nsatellite galaxies by stripping or shocking the gas there. We estimate the\nfraction of gas removed from the satellites as a function of the satellite\ngalaxy's properties. Applying these results to a Milky Way like dark matter\nhalo, we find that this singular shock ram pressure stripping event may be\nquite efficient in removing the gas from the satellites provided that they are\nclose enough. We also use the orbital and mass modelling data for eight\nGalactic dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites, and find that it is likely that\nmany of them have been affected by the Galactic outflow. We point out that\ngalactic outflows of the host may also trigger a starburst in the satellite\ngalaxies by over-pressuring their gas discs. This process may be responsible\nfor the formation of the globular clusters observed in some of the Milky Way's\ndSphs (e.g. the Fornax and Sagittarius dSphs).</td>

      <td>Galaxies with the mass of the Milky Way dominate the stellar mass density of\nthe Universe but it is uncertain how and when they were assembled. Here we\nstudy progenitors of these galaxies out to z=2.5, using data from the 3D-HST\nand CANDELS Treasury surveys. We find that galaxies with present-day stellar\nmasses of log(M)~10.7 built ~90% of their stellar mass since z=2.5, with most\nof the star formation occurring before z=1. In marked contrast to the assembly\nhistory of massive elliptical galaxies, mass growth is not limited to large\nradii: the mass in the central 2 kpc of the galaxies increased by a factor of\n3.2+-0.8 between z=2.5 and z=1. We therefore rule out simple models in which\nbulges were fully assembled at high redshift and disks gradually formed around\nthem. Instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks,\nthrough bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. We find that after\nz=1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continued\nto build, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z~1\ngalaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.</td>

      <td>Aberration in proper motions for stars in our Galaxy</td>
      <td>Accelerations of both the solar system barycenter (SSB) and stars in the\nMilky Way cause a systematic observational effect on the stellar proper\nmotions, which was first studied in the early 1990s and developed by J.\nKovalevsky (aberration in proper motions, 2003, A&A, 404, 743). This paper\nintends to extend that work and aims to estimate the magnitude and significance\nof the aberration in proper motions of stars, especially in the region near the\nGalactic center. We adopt two models for the Galactic rotation curve to\nevaluate the aberrational effect on the Galactic plane. Based on the\ntheoretical developments, we show that the effect of aberration in proper\nmotions depends on the galactocentric distance of stars; it is dominated by the\nacceleration of stars in the central region of the Galaxy. Within 200 pc from\nthe Galactic center, the systematic proper motion can reach an amplitude larger\nthan 1000 uas/yr by applying a flat rotation curve. With a more realistic\nrotation curve which is linearly rising in the core region of the Galaxy, the\naberrational proper motions are limited up to about 150 uas/yr. Then we\ninvestigate the applicability of the theoretical expressions concerning the\naberrational proper motions, especially for those stars with short period\norbits. If the orbital period of stars is only a fraction of the light time\nfrom the star to the SSB, the expression proposed by Kovalevsky is not\nappropriate. With a more suitable formulation, we found that the aberration has\nno effect on the determination of the stellar orbits on the celestial sphere.\nThe aberrational effect under consideration is small but not negligible with\nhigh-accurate astrometry in the future, particularly in constructing the Gaia\ncelestial reference system realized by Galactic stars.</td>

      <td>AGN outflows trigger starbursts in gas-rich galaxies</td>
      <td>Recent well resolved numerical simulations of AGN feedback have shown that\nits effects on the host galaxy may be not only negative but also positive. In\nthe late gas poor phase, AGN feedback blows the gas away and terminates star\nformation. However, in the gas-rich phase(s), AGN outflows trigger star\nformation by over-compressing cold dense gas and thus provide positive feedback\non their hosts. In this paper we study this AGN-triggered starburst effect. We\nshow that star formation rate in the burst increases until the star formation\nfeedback counteracts locally the AGN outflow compression. Globally, this\npredicts a strong nearly linear statistical correlation between the AGN and\nstarburst bolometric luminosities in disc galaxies, L_* \propto L_{AGN}^{5/6}.\nThe correlation is statistical only because AGN activity may fluctuate on short\ntime scales (as short as tens of years), and because AGN may turn off but its\neffects on the host may continue to last until the AGN-driven outflow leaves\nthe host, which may be up to 10 times longer than the duration of the AGN\nactivity. The coefficient in front of this relation depends on the clumpiness\nand morphology of the cold gas in the galaxy. A "maximum starburst" takes place\nin am azimuthally uniform gas disc, for which we derive an upper limit of L_*\n\sim 50 times larger than L_{AGN} for typical quasars. For more clumpy and/or\ncompact cold gas distributions, the starburst luminosity decreases. We also\nsuggest that similar AGN-triggerred starbursts are possible in hosts of all\ngeometries, including during galaxy mergers, provided the AGN is activated.\nFinally, we note that due to the short duration of the AGN activity phase the\naccelerating influence of AGN on starbursts may be much more common than\nobservations of simultaneous AGN and starbursts would suggest.</td>

Our new implementation includes delayed enrichment from\nstellar winds, supernovae type II (SNe-II) and supernovae type Ia (SNe-Ia), as\nwell as metallicity-dependent yields and a reformulation of the associated\nsupernova feedback. Two different sets of SN-II yields and three different\nSN-Ia delay-time distributions (DTDs) are considered, and eleven heavy elements\n(including O, Mg and Fe) are self-consistently tracked. We compare the results\nof this new implementation with data on a) local, star-forming galaxies, b)\nMilky Way disc G dwarfs, and c) local, elliptical galaxies. We find that the\nz=0 gas-phase mass-metallicity relation is very well reproduced for all forms\nof DTD considered, as is the [Fe/H] distribution in the Milky Way disc. The\n[O/Fe] distribution in the Milky Way disc is best reproduced when using a DTD\nwith less than or equal to 50 per cent of SNe-Ia exploding within ~400 Myrs.\nPositive slopes in the mass-[alpha/Fe] relations of local ellipticals are also\nobtained when using a DTD with such a minor `prompt' component. Alternatively,\nmetal-rich winds that drive light alpha elements directly out into the\ncircumgalactic medium also produce positive slopes for all forms of DTD and\nSN-II yields considered. Overall, we find that the best model for matching the\nwide range of observational data considered here should include a power-law\nSN-Ia DTD, SN-II yields that take account of prior mass loss through stellar\nwinds, and some direct ejection of light alpha elements out of galaxies.</td>

      <td>Reaction of Massive Clusters to Gas Expulsion - The cluster density dependence</td>
      <td>The expulsion of the unconverted gas at the end of the star formation process\npotentially leads to the expansion of the just formed stellar cluster and\nmembership loss. The degree of expansion and mass loss depends largely on the\nstar formation efficiency and scales with the mass and size of the stellar\ngroup as long as stellar interactions can be neglected. We investigate under\nwhich circumstances stellar interactions between cluster members become so\nimportant that the fraction of bound stars after gas expulsion is significantly\naltered. The Nbody6 code is used to simulate the cluster dynamics after gas\nexpulsion for different SFEs. Concentrating on the most massive clusters\nobserved in the Milky Way, we test to what extend the results depend on the\nmodel, i.e. stellar mass distribution, stellar density profile etc., and the\ncluster parameters, such as cluster density and size.We find that stellar\ninteractions are responsible for up to 20% mass loss in the most compact\nmassive clusters in the Milky Way, making ejections the prime mass loss process\nin such systems. Even in the loosely bound OB associations stellar interactions\nare responsible for at least ~5% mass loss. The main reason why the importance\nof encounters for massive clusters has been largely overlooked is the often\nused approach of a single-mass representation instead of a realistic\ndistribution for the stellar masses. The density-dependence of the\nencounter-induced mass loss is shallower than expected because of the\nincreasing importance of few-body interactions in dense clusters compared to\nsparse clusters where 2-body encounters dominate.</td>

The foreground stars span distances up to 3kpc from\nthe Galactic plane and Galactocentric radii up to 11kpc.\n  Only three lines-of-sight have a sufficient number of foreground stars for a\nrobust analysis. Towards Sextans in the Northern Galactic hemisphere and\nSculptor in the South, we measure a consistent decrease in mean metallicity\nwith height from the Galactic plane, suggesting a chemically symmetric thick\ndisc. This decrease can either be due to an intrinsic thick disc metallicity\ngradient, or simply due to a change in the thin disc/thick disc population\nratio and no intrinsic metallicity gradients for the thick disc. We favour the\nlatter explanation. In contrast, we find evidence of an unpredicted metal-poor\npopulation in the direction of Carina. This population was earlier detected by\nWyse et al. (2006), but our more detailed analysis provides robust estimates of\nits location (|Z|<1kpc), metallicity (-2<[M/H]<-1 dex) and azimuthal orbital\nvelocity (V_phi ~120 km/s).\n  Given the chemo-dynamical properties of the over-density towards the Carina\nline-of-sight, we suggest that it represents the metal-poor tail of the\ncanonical thick disc. In spite of the small number of stars available, we\nsuggest that this metal-weak thick disc follows the often suggested thick disc\nvelocity-metallicity correlation of dV_phi/d[M/H]~40-50km/s/dex.</td>

The supernova-induced HVS\nproduction rate (\Gamma_HVS) is significantly increased if the binaries are\nhardened via migration through a gaseous disc. Moderate hardening gives\n\Gamma_HVS ~ 2*10^-7 yr^-1 and an estimated population of ~20 HVSs in the last\n100 Myr. Supernova-induced HVS production requires the internal and external\norbital velocity vectors of the secondary binary component to be aligned when\nthe binary is disrupted. This leaves an imprint of the disc geometry on the\nspatial distribution of the HVSs, producing a distinct anisotropy.</td>

      <td>To determine the local dark matter density (LDMD) of the solar system is a\nclassical problem in astronomy. Recently, a novel method of determining the\nLDMD from stellar distribution and vertical velocity dispersion profiles\nperpendicular to the Galactic plane was devised. This method has the advantage\nof abolishing conventional approximations and using only a few assumptions. Our\naims are to carefully scrutinize this method and to examine influences by\nuncertainties of astrometric observations. We discuss how the determinations of\nthe LDMD vary with observational precisions on parallax, proper motion, and\nline-of-sight velocity measurements. To examine the influences by the\nobservational imprecision, we created mock observation data for stars that are\ndynamical tracers based on an analytical galaxy model and applied parametrized\nobservational errors to the mock data. We evaluated the accuracy of determining\nthe LDMD by applying the method to the mock data. In addition, we estimated a\nsample size and observational precision required to determine the LDMD with\naccuracy. We find that the method is capable of determining the LDMD with\naccuracy if the sample size and observational precisions are satisfactory. The\nrandom errors of parallaxes and proper motions can cause systematic\noverestimation of the LDMD. We estimate the required precisions of the parallax\nmeasurements to be approximately 0.1-0.3 milliarcseconds at 1 kpc away from the\nSun; the proper motion precisions do not seem to be as important as the\nparallaxes. From these results, we expect that using the Hipparcos catalog\nwould overestimate the LDMD because of the imprecise parallax measurements if\nthis method is applied; however, we emphasize the capability of the method. We\nexpect that Gaia will provide data precise enough to determine the LDMD.</td>

Motivated by the need for an improvement on\norbit-fitting, we now present an algorithm for constraining the Galactic\npotential using tidal streams without assuming that streams delineate orbits.\nThis approach is independent of the progenitor mass so is valid for all\nobserved tidal streams. The method makes heavy use of angle-action variables\nand seeks the potential which recovers the expected correlations in angle\nspace. We demonstrate that the method can correctly recover the parameters of a\nsimple two-parameter logarithmic potential by analysing an N-body simulation of\na stream. We investigate the magnitude of the errors in observational data for\nwhich the method can still recover the correct potential and compare this to\ncurrent and future errors in data. The errors in the observables of individual\nstars for current and near future data are shown to be too large for the direct\nuse of this method, but when the data are averaged in bins on the sky, the\nresulting averaged data are accurate enough to constrain correctly the\npotential parameters for achievable observational errors. From pseudo-data with\nerrors comparable to those that will be furnished in the era of Gaia (20 per\ncent distance errors, 1.2 mas/yr proper motion errors, and 10 km/s\nline-of-sight velocity errors) we recover the circular velocity, V_c=220 km/s,\nand the flattening of the potential, q=0.9, to be V_c=223+/-10km/s and\nq=0.91+/-0.09.</td>

      <td>Context. Stellar collision rates in globular clusters (GCs) do not appear to\ncorrelate with horizontal branch (HB) morphology, sug- gesting that dynamics\ndoes not play a role in the second-parameter problem. However, core densities\nand collision rates derived from surface-brightness may be significantly\nunderestimated as the surface-brightness profile of GCs is not necessarily a\ngood indicator of the dynamical state of GC cores. Core-collapse may go\nunnoticed if high central densities of dark remnants are present. Aims. We test\nwhether GC HB morphology data supports a dynamical contribution to the\nso-called second-parameter effect. Methods. To remove first-parameter\ndependence we fitted the maximum effective temperature along the HB as a\nfunction of metal- licity in a sample of 54 Milky Way GCs. We plotted the\nresiduals to the fit as a function of second-parameter candidates, namely\ndynamical age and total luminosity. We considered dynamical age (i.e. the ratio\nbetween age and half-light relaxation time) among possible second-parameters.\nWe used a set of direct N-body simulations, including ones with dark remnants\nto illustrate how core density peaks, due to core collapse, in a dynamical-age\nrange similar to that in which blue HBs are overabundant with respect to the\nmetallicity expectation, especially for low-concentration initial conditions.\nResults. GC total luminosity shows nonlinear behavior compatible with the\nself-enrichment picture. However, the data are amenable to a different\ninterpretation based on a dynamical origin of the second-parameter effect.\nEnhanced mass-stripping in the late red-giant- branch phase due to stellar\ninteractions in collapsing cores is a viable candidate mechanism. In this\npicture, GCs with HBs bluer than expected based on metallicity are those\nundergoing core-collapse.</td>

The achieved angular resolution allows us\nto separate, for the first time at far-IR wavelengths, the emission toward the\ncentral cavity (gas in the inner central parsec of the galaxy) from that of the\nsurrounding circum-nuclear disk. The spectrum toward SgrA* is dominated by\nstrong [OIII], [OI], [CII], [NIII], [NII], and [CI] fine structure lines (in\ndecreasing order of luminosity) arising in gas irradiated by UV-photons from\nthe central stellar cluster. In addition, rotationally excited lines of 12CO\n(from J=4-3 to 24-23), 13CO, H2O, OH, H3O+, HCO+ and HCN, as well as\nground-state absorption lines of OH+, H2O+, H3O+, CH+, H2O, OH, HF, CH and NH\nare detected. The excitation of the 12CO ladder is consistent with a hot\nisothermal component at Tk ~ 10^{3.1} K and n(H2)< 10^4 cm^{-3}. It is also\nconsistent with a distribution of temperature components at higher density with\nmost CO at Tk<300 K. The detected molecular features suggest that, at present,\nneither very enhanced X-ray, nor cosmic-ray fluxes play a dominant role in the\nheating of the hot molecular gas. The hot CO component (either the bulk of the\nCO column or just a small fraction depending on the above scenario) results\nfrom a combination of UV- and shock-driven heating. If irradiated dense\nclumps/clouds do not exist, shocks likely dominate the heating of the hot\nmolecular gas. This is consistent with the high-velocity gas detected toward\nSgrA*.</td>

We present the high resolution X-ray spectrum\nthat shows several associated absorption lines. The photoionization model\nrequires two warm absorbers with two different ionization states\n(logU=0.39\pm0.03 and logU=-0.99\pm0.13), both with moderate outflow velocities\n(~100 km s^-1) and relatively low line of sight column densities (logNH=20.94\nand 20.11 cm^-2). The high ionization phase produces absorption lines of OVII,\nOVIII, NeIX, NeX, MgXI, FeXVII and FeXVIII while the low ionization phase\nproduces lines at lower energies (OVI & OVII). The pressure--temperature\nequilibrium curve for the Ark 564 absorber does not have the typical "S" shape,\neven if the metallicity is super-solar; as a result the two warm-absorber\nphases do not appear to be in pressure balance. This suggests that the\ncontinuum incident on the absorbing gas is perhaps different from the observed\ncontinuum. We also estimated the mass outflow rate and the associated kinetic\nenergy and find it to be at most 0.006% of the bolometric luminosity of\nArk~564. Thus it is highly unlikely that these outflows provide significant\nfeedback required by the galaxy formation models.</td>

      <td>Assessing the influence of the solar orbit on terrestrial biodiversity</td>
      <td>The terrestrial fossil record shows a significant variation in the extinction\nand origination rates of species during the past half billion years. Numerous\nstudies have claimed an association between this variation and the motion of\nthe Sun around the Galaxy, invoking the modulation of cosmic rays, gamma rays\nand comet impact frequency as a cause of this biodiversity variation. However,\nsome of these studies exhibit methodological problems, or were based on coarse\nassumptions (such as a strict periodicity of the solar orbit). Here we\ninvestigate this link in more detail, using a model of the Galaxy to\nreconstruct the solar orbit and thus a predictive model of the temporal\nvariation of the extinction rate due to astronomical mechanisms. We compare\nthese predictions as well as those of various reference models with\npaleontological data. Our approach involves Bayesian model comparison, which\ntakes into account the uncertainties in the paleontological data as well as the\ndistribution of solar orbits consistent with the uncertainties in the\nastronomical data. We find that various versions of the orbital model are not\nfavored beyond simpler reference models. In particular, the distribution of\nmass extinction events can be explained just as well by a uniform random\ndistribution as by any other model tested. Although our negative results on the\norbital model are robust to changes in the Galaxy model, the Sun's coordinates\nand the errors in the data, we also find that it would be very difficult to\npositively identify the orbital model even if it were the true one. (In\ncontrast, we do find evidence against simpler periodic models.) Thus while we\ncannot rule out there being some connection between solar motion and\nbiodiversity variations on the Earth, we conclude that it is difficult to give\nconvincing positive conclusions of such a connection using current data.</td>

The results are in\nagreement with recent small- and large-scale studies, with high and low\nprecision, respectively. Large-number statistics cannot fully compensate for\nlow precision in the abundance measurements and each survey should carefully\nevaluate what the main science drivers are for the survey and ensure that the\nchosen observational strategy will result in the precision necessary to answer\nthe questions posed.</td>

This object, which has been\nlargely neglected, shows however a rather high surface brightness, a high\nionization degree and is located at a galactocentric distance of 12.4 $\pm$ 0.7\nkpc. Therefore, NGC 2579 is an excellent probe for studying the behaviour of\nthe gas phase radial abundance gradients in the outer disc of the Milky Way. We\nderive the physical conditions of the nebula using several emission\nline-intensity ratios as well as the abundances of several ionic species from\nthe intensity of collisionally excited lines. We also determine the ionic\nabundances of C$^{2+}$, O$^+$ and O$^{2+}$ -- and therefore the total O\nabundance -- from faint pure recombination lines. The results for NGC 2579\npermit to extend our previous determinations of the C, O and C/O gas phase\nradial gradients of the inner Galactic disc (Esteban etal. 2005) to larger\ngalactocentric distances. We find that the chemical composition of NGC 2579 is\nconsistent with flatten gradients at its galactocentric distance. In addition,\nwe have built a tailored chemical evolution model that reproduces the observed\nradial abundance gradients of O, C and N and other observational constraints.\nWe find that a levelling out of the star formation efficiency about and beyond\nthe isophotal radius can explain the flattening of chemical gradients observed\nin the outer Galactic disc.</td>

      <td>Properties of Dust Grains Probed with Extinction Curves</td>
      <td>Modern data of the extinction curve from the ultraviolet to the near infrared\nare revisited to study the property of dust grains in the Milky Way (MW) and\nthe Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We confirm that the graphite-silicate mixture\nof grains yields the observed extinction curve with the simple power-law\ndistribution of the grain size but with a cutoff at some maximal size: the\nparameters are tightly constrained to be $q = 3.5 \pm 0.2$ for the size\ndistribution $a^{-q}$ and the maximum radius $a_{max} = 0.24 \pm 0.05$ um, for\nboth MW and SMC. The abundance of grains, and hence the elemental abundance, is\nconstrained from the reddening versus hydrogen column density, E(B-V)/N_H. If\nwe take the solar elemental abundance as the standard for the MW, >56 % of\ncarbon should be in graphite dust, while it is <40 % in the SMC using its\navailable abundance estimate. This disparity and the relative abundance of C to\nSi explain the difference of the two curves. We find that 50-60 % of carbon may\nnot necessarily be in graphite but in the amorphous or the glassy phase. Iron\nmay also be in the metallic phase or up to ~80 % in magnetite rather than in\nsilicates, so that the Mg/Fe ratio in astronomical olivine is arbitrary. With\nthese substitutions the parameters of the grain size remain unchanged. The mass\ndensity of dust grains relative to hydrogen is $\rho_{dust}/\rho_H = 1/(120\n{+10 \atop -16})$ for the MW and $1/(760 {+70 \atop -90}) for the SMC under\nsome abundance constraints. We underline the importance of the\nwavelength-dependence slope of the extinction curve in the near infrared in\nconstructing the dust model: if $A_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^{-gamma}$ with\ngamma ~ 1.6, the power-law grain-size model fails, whereas it works if gamma ~\n1.8-2.0.</td>

Despite Leo\nI's large Galacto-centric space velocity (200 km/s) and distance (261 kpc), we\nshow that it is extremely unlikely to be unbound if Galactic satellites are\nassociated with dark matter substructure, as 99.9% of subhalos in the\nsimulations are bound to their host. The observed position and velocity of Leo\nI strongly disfavor a low mass Milky Way: if we assume that Leo I is the least\nbound of the Milky Way's classical satellites, then we find that M_MW > 10^{12}\nM_sun at 95% confidence for a variety of Bayesian priors on M_MW. In lower mass\nhalos, it is vanishingly rare to find subhalos at 261 kpc moving as fast as Leo\nI. Should an additional classical satellite be found to be less bound than Leo\nI, this lower limit on M_MW would increase by 30%. Imposing a mass weighted\nLCDM prior, we find a median Milky Way virial mass of M_MW=1.6 x 10^{12} M_sun,\nwith a 90% confidence interval of [1.0-2.4] x 10^{12} M_sun.

In addition, we investigate the dependence of the mean SED\non various parameters, particularly the UV luminosity for quasars with 0.5<z<3\nand the properties of the UV emission lines for quasars with z>1.6; the latter\nis a possible indicator of the strength of the accretion disk wind, which is\nexpected to be SED dependent. Luminosity-dependent mean SEDs show that,\nrelative to the high-luminosity SED, low-luminosity SEDs exhibit a harder\n(bluer) far-UV spectral slope, a redder optical continuum, and less hot dust.\nMean SEDs constructed instead as a function of UV emission line properties\nreveal changes that are consistent with known Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) trends. A potentially important contribution to the bolometric correction\nis the unseen extream-UV (EUV) continuum. Our work suggests that\nlower-luminosity quasars and/or quasars with disk-dominated broad emission\nlines may require an extra continuum component in the EUV that is not present\n(or much weaker) in high-luminosity quasars with strong accretion disk winds.\nAs such, we consider four possible models and explore the resulting bolometric\ncorrections.

Starting from the two-infall model for the\nGalaxy, which predicts too few low-metallicity stars, we add a gas outflow\nduring the halo phase with a rate proportional to the star formation rate\nthrough a free parameter, lambda. In addition, we consider a first generation\nof massive zero-metal stars in this two-infall + outflow model adopting two\ndifferent top-heavy initial mass functions and specific population III yields.\nThe metallicity distribution function of halo stars, as predicted by the\ntwo-infall + outflow model shows a good agreement with observations, when the\nparameter lambda=14 and the time scale for the first infall, out of which the\nhalo formed, is not longer than 0.2 Gyr, a lower value than suggested\npreviously. Moreover, the abundance patterns [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] for C, N and\nalpha-elements O, Mg, Si, S, Ca show a good agreement with the observational\ndata. If population III stars are included, under the assumption of different\ninitial mass functions, the overall agreement of the predicted stellar\nmetallicity distribution function with observational data is poorer than in the\ncase without population III. We conclude that it is fundamental to include both\na gas infall and outflow during the halo formation to explain the observed halo\nmetallicity distribution function, in the framework of a model assuming that\nthe stars in the inner halo formed mostly in situ. Moreover, we find that it\ndoes not exist a satisfactory initial mass function for population III stars\nwhich reproduces the observed halo metallicity distribution function. As a\nconsequence, there is no need for a first generation of only massive stars to\nexplain the evolution of the Galactic halo.</td>

      <td>ARGOS IV: The Kinematics of the Milky Way Bulge</td>
      <td>We present the kinematic results from our ARGOS spectroscopic survey of the\nGalactic bulge of the Milky Way. Our aim is to understand the formation of the\nGalactic bulge. We examine the kinematics of about 17,400 stars in the bulge\nlocated within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic centre, identified from the 28,000 star\nARGOS survey. We aim to determine if the formation of the bulge has been\ninternally driven from disk instabilities as suggested by its boxy shape, or if\nmergers have played a significant role as expected from Lambda CDM simulations.\nFrom our velocity measurements across latitudes b = -5 deg, -7.5 deg and -10\ndeg we find the bulge to be a cylindrically rotating system that transitions\nsmoothly out into the disk. Within the bulge, we find a kinematically distinct\nmetal-poor population ([Fe/H] < -1.0) that is not rotating cylindrically. The\n5% of our stars with [Fe/H] < -1.0 are a slowly rotating spheroidal population,\nwhich we believe are stars of the metal weak thick disk and halo which\npresently lie in the inner Galaxy. The kinematics of the two bulge components\nthat we identified in ARGOS paper III (mean [Fe/H] = -0.25 and [Fe/H] = +0.15,\nrespectively) demonstrate that they are likely to share a common formation\norigin and are distinct from the more metal poor populations of the thick disk\nand halo which are colocated inside the bulge. We do not exclude an underlying\nmerger generated bulge component but our results favour bulge formation from\ninstabilities in the early thin disk.</td>

      <td>We present an analysis of the s-process elements Zr, Ba, and La and the\nr-process element Eu in a sample of 50 stars in 19 open clusters. Stellar\nabundances of each element are based on measures of a minimum of two lines per\nspecies via both equivalent width and spectrum synthesis techniques. We\ninvestigate cluster mean neutron-capture abundance trends as a function of\ncluster age and location in the Milky Way disk and compare them to results\nfound in other studies in the literature. We find a statistically significant\ntrend of increasing cluster [Ba/Fe] as a function of decreasing cluster age, in\nagreement with recent findings for other open cluster samples, supporting the\nincreased importance of low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars to the\ngeneration of s-process elements. However, the other s-process elements,\n[La/Fe] and [Zr/Fe], do not show similar dependences, in contrast to\ntheoretical expectations and the limited observational data from other studies.\nConversely, cluster [Eu/Fe] ratios show a slight increase with increasing\ncluster age, although with marginal statistical significance. Ratios of\n[s/r]-process abundances, [Ba/Eu] and [La/Eu], however, show more clearly the\nincreasing efficiency of s-process relative to r-process enrichment in open\ncluster chemical evolution, with significant increases among younger clusters.\nLast, cluster neutron-capture element abundances appear to be independent of\nGalactocentric distance. We conclude that a homogeneous analysis of a larger\nsample of open clusters is needed to resolve the apparent discrepant\nconclusions between different studies regarding s-process element abundance\ntrends with age to better inform models of galactic chemical evolution.</td>

      <td>(abridged) We want to provide further evidence of the origin of the proposed\nstellar members of Chamaeleon and to identify interlopers from the foreground\n\epsilon Cha and \eta Cha associations. To this aim, we compile lists of\nspectroscopically confirmed members of Chamaeleon I and II, \epsilon Cha and\n\eta Cha, and of background objects in the same line of sight. Using Virtual\nObservatory tools, we cross-match these lists with the UCAC3 catalogue to get\nthe proper motions of the objects. In the vector point diagram, we identify the\ndifferent moving groups, and use this information to study the membership of\nproposed candidate members of the associations from the literature. For those\nobjects with available radial velocities, we compute their Galactic space\nvelocities. We look for correlations between the known properties of the\nobjects and their proper motions. The members of the dark clouds exhibit\nclearly different proper motions from those of the foreground associations and\nof the background stars. The data suggest that Chamaeleon II could have\ndifferent dynamical properties from Chamaeleon I. Although the two foreground\nclusters \epsilon and \eta Chamaeleontis constitute two different proper motion\ngroups, they have similar spatial motions, which are different from the spatial\nmotion of Chamaeleon I. On the other hand, the space motions of the Chamaeleon\nII stars look more similar to those of the foreground clusters than to the\nChamaeleon I stars, but the numbers are low. Hence, with the available data it\nis unclear to what extent the stellar populations in both clouds are physically\nconnected to each other. We find no correlations between the proper motions and\nthe properties of the objects in either of the clouds.</td>

      <td>Metallicity gradients through disk Instability: A simple model for the Milky Way's boxy bulge</td>
      <td>Observations show a clear vertical metallicity gradient in the Galactic\nbulge, which is often taken as a signature of dissipative processes in the\nformation of a classical bulge. Various evidence shows, however, that the Milky\nWay is a barred galaxy with a boxy bulge representing the inner\nthree-dimensional part of the bar. Here we show with a secular evolution N-body\nmodel that a boxy bulge formed through bar and buckling instabilities can show\nvertical metallicity gradients similar to the observed gradient, if the initial\naxisymmetric disk had a comparable radial metallicity gradient. In this\nframework the range of metallicities in bulge fields constrains the chemical\nstructure of the Galactic disk at early times, before bar formation. Our\nsecular evolution model was previously shown to reproduce inner Galaxy star\ncounts and we show here that it also has cylindrical rotation. We use it to\npredict a full mean metallicity map across the Galactic bulge from a simple\nmetallicity model for the initial disk. This map shows a general outward\ngradient on the sky as well as longitudinal perspective asymmetries. We also\nbriefly comment on interpreting metallicity gradient observations in external\nboxy bulges.</td>

The spectra\nof the innermost regions are dominated by broad brackett series emission lines\nand non-stellar continuum, under which we are able to trace the distribution\nand kinematics of the stars and also the [Fe II] line emission. We find that\nthere is a counter-rotating stellar core extending out to 125 pc, which appears\nto be associated with the [Fe II] emission. Based on the mass-to-light ratio,\nand the presence of this emission line, we estimate the age of the central\nstellar population to be of order of 65 Myr.

      <td>Retention of Stellar-Mass Black Holes in Globular Clusters</td>
      <td>Globular clusters should be born with significant numbers of stellar-mass\nblack holes (BHs). It has been thought for two decades that very few of these\nBHs could be retained through the cluster lifetime. With masses ~10 MSun, BHs\nare ~20 times more massive than an average cluster star. They segregate into\nthe cluster core, where they may eventually decouple from the remainder of the\ncluster. The small-N core then evaporates on a short timescale. This is the\nso-called Spitzer instability. Here we present the results of a full dynamical\nsimulation of a globular cluster containing many stellar-mass BHs with a\nrealistic mass spectrum. Our Monte Carlo simulation code includes detailed\ntreatments of all relevant stellar evolution and dynamical processes. Our main\nfinding is that old globular clusters could still contain many BHs at present.\nIn our simulation, we find no evidence for the Spitzer instability. Instead,\nmost of the BHs remain well-mixed with the rest of the cluster, with only the\ninnermost few tens of BHs segregating significantly. Over the 12 Gyr evolution,\nfewer than half of the BHs are dynamically ejected through strong binary\ninteractions in the cluster core. The presence of BHs leads to long-term\nheating of the cluster, ultimately producing a core radius on the high end of\nthe distribution for Milky Way globular clusters (and those of other galaxies).\nA crude extrapolation from our model suggests that the BH--BH merger rate from\nglobular clusters could be comparable to the rate in the field.</td>

We use the VISTA variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey\ndata and 2MASS photometry, covering 320 sqdeg of the Galactic bulge, to derive\nphotometric metallicities by interpolating of the (J-Ks)0 colors of individual\nRed Giant Branch stars based on a set of globular cluster ridge lines. We then\nuse this information to construct the first global metallicity map of the bulge\nwith a resolution of 30'x45'. The metallicity map of the bulge revealed a clear\nvertical metallicity gradient of ~0.04 dex/deg (~0.28 dex/kpc), with metal-rich\nstars ([Fe/H]~0) dominating the inner bulge in regions closer to the galactic\nplane (|b|<5). At larger scale heights, the mean metallicity of the bulge\npopulation becomes significantly more metal-poor. This fits in the scenario of\na boxy-bulge originated from the vertical inestability of the Galactic bar,\nformed early via secular evolution of a two component stellar disk. Older,\nmetal-poor stars dominate at higher scale heights due to the non-mixed orbits\nfrom the originally hotter thick disk stars.</td>

      <td>The Bizarre Chemical Inventory of NGC 2419, An Extreme Outer Halo Globular Cluster</td>
      <td>We present new Keck/HIRES observations of six red giants in the globular\ncluster NGC 2419. Although the cluster is among the most distant and most\nluminous in the Milky Way, it was considered chemically ordinary until very\nrecently. Our previous work showed that the near-infrared Ca II triplet line\nstrength varied more than expected for a chemically homogeneous cluster, and\nthat at least one star had unusual abundances of Mg and K. Here, we confirm\nthat NGC 2419 harbors a population of stars, comprising about one third of its\nmass, that is depleted in Mg by a factor of 8 and enhanced in K by a factor of\n6 with respect to the Mg-normal population. Although the majority, Mg-normal\npopulation appears to have a chemical abundance pattern indistinguishable from\nordinary, inner halo globular clusters, the Mg-poor population exhibits\ndispersions of several elements. The abundances of K and Sc are strongly\nanti-correlated with Mg, and some other elements (Si and Ca among others) are\nweakly anti-correlated with Mg. These abundance patterns suggest that the\ndifferent populations of NGC 2419 sample the ejecta of diverse supernovae in\naddition to AGB ejecta. However, the abundances of Fe-peak elements except Sc\nshow no star-to-star variation. We find no nucleosynthetic source that\nsatisfactorily explains all of the abundance variations in this cluster.\nBecause NGC 2419 appears like no other globular cluster, we reiterate our\nprevious suggestion that it is not a globular cluster at all, but rather the\ncore of an accreted dwarf galaxy.</td>

      <td>Accretion Disc Particle Accretion in Major Merger Simulations</td>
      <td>A recent approach to simulating localized feedback from active galactic\nnuclei by Power et al. (2011) uses an accretion disc particle to represent both\nthe black hole and its accretion disc. We have extrapolated and adapted this\napproach to simulations of Milky Way-sized galaxy mergers containing black\nholes and explored the impact of the various parameters in this model as well\nas its resolution dependence. The two key parameters in the model are an\neffective accretion radius, which determines the radius within which gas\nparticles are added to the accretion disc, and a viscous time-scale which\ndetermines how long it takes for material in the accretion disc to accrete on\nto the black hole itself. We find that there is a limited range of permitted\naccretion radii and viscous time-scales, with unphysical results produced\noutside this range. For permitted model parameters, the nuclear regions of\nsimulations with the same resolution follow similar evolutionary paths,\nproducing final black hole masses that are consistent within a factor of two.\nWhen comparing the resolution dependence of the model, there is a trend towards\nhigher resolution producing slightly lower mass black holes, but values for the\ntwo resolutions studied again agree within a factor of two. We also compare\nthese results to two other AGN feedback algorithms found in the literature.\nWhile the evolution of the systems vary, most notably the intermediate total\nblack hole mass, the final black hole masses differ by less than a factor of\nfive amongst all of our models, and the remnants exhibit similar structural\nparameters. The implication of this accretion model is that, unlike most\naccretion algorithms, a decoupling of the accretion rate on to the black hole\nand the local gas properties is permitted and obtained; this allows for black\nhole growth even after feedback has prevented additional accretion events on to\nthe disc.</td>

Our aim here is to study the\neffects of galactic fountains and radial gas flows in the chemical evolution of\nthe disk of M31. We adopt a ballistic method to study the effects of galactic\nfountains on the chemical enrichment of the M31 disk. We find that the landing\ncoordinate for the fountains in M31 is no more than 1 kpc from the starting\npoint, thus producing negligible effect on the chemical evolution of the disk.\nWe find that the delay time in the enrichment process due to fountains is no\nlonger than 100 Myr and this timescale also produces negligible effects on the\nresults. Then, we compute the chemical evolution of the M31 disk with radial\ngas flows produced by the infall of extragalactic material and fountains. We\nfind that a moderate inside-out formation of the disk coupled with radial flows\nof variable speed can very well reproduce the observed gradient. We discuss\nalso the effects of other parameters such a threshold in the gas density for\nstar formation and an efficiency of star formation varying with the galactic\nradius. We conclude that the most important physical processes in creating disk\ngradients are the inside-out formation and the radial gas flows. More data on\nabundance gradients both locally and at high redshift are necessary to confirm\nthis conclusion.</td>

Targets were selected from the Ca II triplet (CaT) survey of the\nDwarf Abundances and Radial Velocities Team (DART) using the latest\ncalibration. Of the seven extremely metal-poor candidates, five stars are\nconfirmed to be extremely metal-poor (i.e., [Fe/H]<-3 dex), with [Fe/H]=-3.47\n+/- 0.07 for our most metal-poor star. All are around or below [Fe/H]=-2.5 dex\nfrom the measurement of individual Fe lines. These values are in agreement with\nthe CaT predictions to within error bars. None of the seven stars is found to\nbe carbon-rich. We estimate a 2-13% possibility of this being a pure chance\neffect, which could indicate a lower fraction of carbon-rich extremely\nmetal-poor stars in Sculptor compared to the Milky Way halo. The [alpha/Fe]\nratios show a range from +0.5 to -0.5, a larger variation than seen in Galactic\nsamples although typically consistent within 1-2sigma. One star seems mildly\niron-enhanced. Our program stars show no deviations from the Galactic abundance\ntrends in chromium and the heavy elements barium and strontium. Sodium\nabundances are, however, below the Galactic values for several stars. Overall,\nwe conclude that the CaT lines are a successful metallicity indicator down to\nthe extremely metal-poor regime and that the extremely metal-poor stars in the\nSculptor dwarf galaxy are chemically more similar to their Milky Way halo\nequivalents than the more metal-rich population of stars.</td>

Methods. We used the MIR instrument VISIR in\nthe BURST imaging mode, the adaptive optics assisted NIR camera NACO, and the\nsub-mm antenna APEX to monitor Sgr A* over several nights in July 2007.\nResults. The observations reveal remarkable variability in the NIR and sub-mm\nduring the five nights of observation. No source was detected in the MIR, but\nwe derived the lowest upper limit for a flare at 8.59 microns (22.4 mJy with\nA_8.59mu = 1.6+/- 0.5). This observational constraint makes us discard the\nobserved NIR emission as coming from a thermal component emitting at sub-mm\nfrequencies. Moreover, comparison of the sub-mm and NIR variability shows that\nthe highest NIR fluxes (flares) are coincident with the lowest sub-mm levels of\nour five-night campaign involving three flares. We explain this behavior by a\nloss of electrons to the system and/or by a decrease in the magnetic field, as\nmight conceivably occur in scenarios involving fast outflows and/or magnetic\nreconnection.</td>

      <td>Constraints on the Galactic Halo Dark Matter from Fermi-LAT Diffuse Measurements</td>
      <td>We have performed an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission with the\nFermi Large Area Telescope in the Milky Way Halo region searching for a signal\nfrom dark matter annihilation or decay. In the absence of a robust dark matter\nsignal, constraints are presented. We consider both gamma rays produced\ndirectly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse Compton\nscattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. Conservative limits\nare derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observed\ndiffuse gamma-ray emission. A second set of more stringent limits is derived\nbased on modeling the foreground astrophysical diffuse emission using the\nGALPROP code. Uncertainties in the height of the diffusive cosmic-ray halo, the\ndistribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the Galaxy, the index of the\ninjection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of the\ninterstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,\nwhile the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derived\nfrom fits to local cosmic-ray data. The resulting limits impact the range of\nparticle masses over which dark matter thermal production in the early Universe\nis possible, and challenge the interpretation of the PAMELA/Fermi-LAT cosmic\nray anomalies as annihilation of dark matter.</td>

      <td>Initial Size Distribution of the Galactic Globular Cluster System</td>
      <td>Despite the importance of their size evolution in understanding the dynamical\nevolution of globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way, studies are rare that\nfocus specifically on this issue. Based on the advanced, realistic\nFokker-Planck (FP) approach, we predict theoretically the initial size\ndistribution (SD) of the Galactic GCs along with their initial mass function\nand radial distribution. Over one thousand FP calculations in a wide parameter\nspace have pinpointed the best-fit initial conditions for the SD, mass\nfunction, and radial distribution. Our best-fit model shows that the initial SD\nof the Galactic GCs is of larger dispersion than today's SD, and that typical\nprojected half-light radius of the initial GCs is ~4.6 pc, which is 1.8 times\nlarger than that of the present-day GCs (~2.5 pc). Their large size signifies\ngreater susceptibility to the Galactic tides: the total mass of destroyed GCs\nreaches 3-5x10^8 M_sun$, several times larger than the previous estimates. Our\nresult challenges a recent view that the Milky Way GCs were born compact on the\nsub-pc scale, and rather implies that (1) the initial GCs are generally larger\nthan the typical size of the present-day GCs, (2) the initially large GCs\nmostly shrink and/or disrupt as a result of the galactic tides, and (3) the\ninitially small GCs expand by two-body relaxation, and later shrink by the\ngalactic tides.</td>

      <td>The Kepler space telescope has opened new vistas in exoplanet discovery space\nby revealing populations of Earth-sized planets that provide a new context for\nunderstanding planet formation. Approximately 70% of all stars in the Galaxy\nbelong to the diminutive M dwarf class, several thousand of which lie within\nKepler's field of view, and a large number of these targets show planet transit\nsignals. Kepler-32 is a typical star in the Kepler M dwarf sample that presents\nus with a rare opportunity: five planets transit this star giving us an\nexpansive view of its architecture. All five planets of this compact system\norbit their host star within a distance one third the size of Mercury's orbit\nwith the innermost planet positioned a mere 4.3 stellar radii from the stellar\nphotosphere. New observations limit possible false positive scenarios allowing\nus to validate the entire Kepler-32 system making it the richest known system\nof transiting planets around an M dwarf. Based on considerations of the stellar\ndust sublimation radius, the near period commensurability of three adjacent\nplanets, a minimum mass protoplanetary nebula, and the volatile content\ninferred for the planets, we propose that the Kepler-32 planets formed at\nlarger orbital radii and migrated inward to their present locations. The\nvolatile content inferred for the Kepler-32 planets and order of magnitude\nestimates for the disk migration rates suggest these planets may have formed\nbeyond the snow line and migrated in the presence of a gaseous disk. The\nKepler-32 planets are representative of the full ensemble of planet candidates\norbiting the Kepler M dwarfs for which we calculate an occurrence rate of 1.0\n+/- 0.1 planet per star. The formation of the Kepler-32 planets therefore\noffers a plausible blueprint for the formation of one of the largest known\npopulations of planets in our Galaxy.</td>

      <td>Hydrodynamics of galaxy mergers with supermassive black holes: is there a last parsec problem ?</td>
      <td>We study the formation of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary and the\nshrinking of the separation of the two holes to sub-pc scales starting from a\nrealistic major merger between two gas-rich spiral galaxies with mass\ncomparable to our Milky Way. The simulations, carried out with the Adaptive\nMesh Refinement (AMR) code RAMSES, are capable of resolving separations as\nsmall as 0.1 pc. The collision of the two galaxies produces a gravo-turbulent\nrotating nuclear disk with mass (10^9 Msun) and size (60 pc) in excellent\nagreement with previous SPH simulations with particle splitting that used a\nsimilar setup (Mayer et al. 2007) but were limited to separations of a few\nparsecs. The AMR results confirm that the two black holes sink rapidly as a\nresult of dynamical friction onto the gaseous background, reaching a separation\nof 1 pc in less than 10^7 yr. We show that the dynamical friction wake is well\nresolved by our model and we find good agreement with analytical predictions of\nthe drag force as a function of the Mach number. Below 1 pc, black hole pairing\nslows down significantly, as the relative velocity between the sinking SMBH\nbecomes highly subsonic and the mass contained within their orbit falls below\nthe mass of the binary itself, rendering dynamical friction ineffective. In\nthis final stage, the black holes have not opened a gap as the gaseous\nbackground is highly pressurized in the center. Non-axisymmetric gas torques do\nnot arise to restart sinking in absence of efficient dynamical friction, at\nvariance with previous calculations using idealized equilibrium nuclear disk\nmodels.

      <td>Very Metal-Poor Outer-Halo Stars with Round Orbits</td>
      <td>The orbital motions of halo stars in the Milky Way reflect the orbital\nmotions of the progenitor systems in which they formed, making it possible to\ntrace the mass-assembly history of the Galaxy. Direct measurement of\nthree-dimensional velocities, based on accurate proper motions and\nline-of-sight velocities, has revealed that the majority of halo stars in the\ninner-halo region move on eccentric orbits. However, our understanding of the\nmotions of distant, in-situ halo-star samples is still limited, due to the lack\nof accurate proper motions for these stars. Here we explore a model-independent\nanalysis of the line-of-sight velocities and spatial distribution of a recent\nsample of 1865 carefully selected halo blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars\nwithin 30 kpc of the Galactic center. We find that the mean rotational velocity\nof the very metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -2.0) BHB stars significantly lags behind that\nof the relatively more metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -2.0) BHB stars. We also find that\nthe relatively more metal-rich BHB stars are dominated by stars with eccentric\norbits, as previously observed for other stellar samples in the inner-halo\nregion. By contrast, the very metal-poor BHB stars are dominated by stars on\nrounder, lower-eccentricity orbits. Our results indicate that the motion of the\nprogenitor systems of the Milky Way that contributed to the stellar populations\nfound within 30 kpc correlates directly with their metal abundance, which may\nbe related to their physical properties such as gas fractions. These results\nare consistent with the existence of an inner/outer halo structure for the halo\nsystem, as advocated by Carollo et al. (2010).</td>

      <td>Confronting theoretical models with the observed evolution of the galaxy population out to z=4</td>
      <td>[abridged] We construct lightcones for the semi-analytic galaxy formation\nsimulation of Guo et al. (2011) and make mock catalogues for comparison with\ndeep high-redshift surveys. Photometric properties are calculated with two\ndifferent stellar population synthesis codes (Bruzual & Charlot 2003; Maraston\n2005) in order to study sensitivity to this aspect of the modelling. The\ncatalogues are publicly available and include photometry for a large number of\nobserved bands from 4000{\deg}A to 6{\mu}m, as well as rest-frame photometry\nand intrinsic properties of the galaxies. Guo et al. (2011) tuned their model\nto fit the low-redshift galaxy population but noted that at z > 1 it\noverpredicts the abundance of galaxies below the "knee" of the stellar mass\nfunction. Here we extend the comparison to deep galaxy counts in the B, i, J, K\nand IRAC 3.6{\mu}m, 4.5{\mu}m and 5.8{\mu}m bands, to the redshift\ndistributions of K and 5.8{\mu}m selected galaxies, and to the evolution of\nrest-frame luminosity functions in the B and K bands. The B, i and J counts are\nwell reproduced, but at longer wavelengths the overabundant high-redshift\ngalaxies produce excess faint counts. The predicted redshift distributions for\nK and 5.8{\mu}m selected samples highlight the effect of emission from\nthermally pulsing AGB stars. The full treatment of Maraston (2005) predicts\nthree times as many z~2 galaxies in faint 5.8{\mu}m selected samples as the\nmodel of Bruzual & Charlot (2003), whereas the two models give similar\npredictions for K-band selected samples. Although luminosity functions are\nadequately reproduced out to z~3 in rest-frame B, the same is true at\nrest-frame K only if TP-AGB emission is included, and then only at high\nluminosity. Fainter than L* the two synthesis models agree but overpredict the\nnumber of galaxies, another reflection of the overabundance of ~10^10M\odot\nmodel galaxies at z > 1.</td>

      <td>The next generation of galaxy surveys will observe millions of galaxies over\nlarge volumes of the universe. These surveys are expensive both in time and\ncost, raising questions regarding the optimal investment of this time and\nmoney. In this work we investigate criteria for selecting amongst observing\nstrategies for constraining the galaxy power spectrum and a set of cosmological\nparameters. Depending on the parameters of interest, it may be more efficient\nto observe a larger, but sparsely sampled, area of sky instead of a smaller\ncontiguous area. In this work, by making use of the principles of Bayesian\nExperimental Design, we will investigate the advantages and disadvantages of\nthe sparse sampling of the sky and discuss the circumstances in which a sparse\nsurvey is indeed the most efficient strategy. For the Dark Energy Survey (DES),\nwe find that by sparsely observing the same area in a smaller amount of time,\nwe only increase the errors on the parameters by a maximum of 0.45%.\nConversely, investing the same amount of time as the original DES to observe a\nsparser but larger area of sky we can in fact constrain the parameters with\nerrors reduced by 28%.</td>

      <td>Is there an intermediate massive black hole in the Galactic center: Imprints on the stellar tidal-disruption rate</td>
      <td>It has been suggested that an intermediate-massive black hole (IMBH) with\nmass $10^{3-5} M_\odot$ could fall into the galactic center (GC) and form a\nmassive black hole binary (MBHB) with the central supermassive black hole, but\ncurrent observations are not sensitive to constrain all mass and distance\nranges. Motivated by the recent discovery that MBHBs could enhance the rate of\ntidal-disruption events (TDEs) of stellar objects, we investigate the prospect\nof using stellar-disruption rate to probe IMBHs in the GC. We incorporated the\nperturbation by an IMBH into the loss-cone theory and calculated the\nstellar-disruption rates in the GC. We found that an IMBH heavier than $2000\nM_\odot$ could distinguishably enhance the stellar-disruption rate. By\ncomparing observations of Sgr A* with the fall-back model for stellar debris,\nwe suggested that the TDE rate in our Galaxy should not significantly exceed\n$0.002 yr^{-1}$, therefore a fraction of the parameter space for the IMBH,\nconcentrating at the high-mass end, can already be excluded. To derive\nconstraint in the remaining parameter space, it is crucial to observationally\nconfirm or reject the stellar-disruption rate between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-2}\nyr^{-1}$, and we discussed possible strategies to make such measurements.</td>

      <td>We apply Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods to large-scale simulations\nof galaxy formation in a LambdaCDM cosmology in order to explore how star\nformation and feedback are constrained by the observed luminosity and stellar\nmass functions of galaxies. We build models jointly on the Millennium and\nMillennium-II simulations, applying fast sampling techniques which allow\nobserved galaxy abundances over the ranges 7<log(M*/Msun)<12 and z=0 to z=3 to\nbe used simultaneously as constraints in the MCMC analysis. When z=0\nconstraints alone are imposed, we reproduce the results of previous modelling\nby Guo et al. (2012), but no single set of parameters can reproduce observed\ngalaxy abundances at all redshifts simultaneously, reflecting the fact that\nlow-mass galaxies form too early and thus are overabundant at high redshift in\nthis model. The data require the efficiency with which galactic wind ejecta are\nreaccreted to vary with redshift and halo mass quite differently than\npreviously assumed, but in a similar way as in some recent hydrodynamic\nsimulations of galaxy formation. We propose a specific model in which\nreincorporation timescales vary inversely with halo mass and are independent of\nredshift. This produces an evolving galaxy population which fits observed\nabundances as a function of stellar mass, B- and K-band luminosity at all\nredshifts simultaneously. It also produces a significant improvement in two\nother areas where previous models were deficient. It leads to present day dwarf\ngalaxy populations which are younger, bluer, more strongly star-forming and\nmore weakly clustered on small scales than before, although the passive\nfraction of faint dwarfs remains too high.</td>

No such black holes have been found in any Milky Way globular\ncluster until the recent discovery of stellar-mass black holes in the globular\ncluster M22 (NGC 6656) with now an estimated population of 5-100 black holes.\nWe present a direct N-body model of a star cluster of the same absolute and\ndynamical age as M22. Imposing an initial retention fraction of approx. 10% for\nblack holes, 16 stellar-remnant black holes are retained at a cluster age of 12\nGyr, in agreement with the estimate for M22. Of those 16 BHs, two are in a\nbinary system with a main sequence star each while also one pure black hole\nbinary is present. We argue that multiple black holes can be present in any\nMilky Way cluster with an extended core radius, such as M22 or the model\npresented here.</td>

The\nmodels are built to reproduce three observational constraints of the M33 disk:\nthe radial distributions of the total baryonic mass, the gas mass, and the O/H\nabundance. From observations, we find that the total baryonic mass profile in\nM33 has a double exponential behavior, decreasing exponentially for r<= 6 kpc,\nand increasing lightly for r > 6 kpc due to the increase of the gas mass\nsurface density. To adopt a concordant set of stellar and H II regions O/H\nvalues, we had to correct the latter for the effect of temperature variations\nand O dust depletion. Our best model shows a good agreement with the observed\nthe radial distributions of: the SFR, the stellar mass, C/H, N/H, Ne/H, Mg/H,\nSi/H, P/H, S/H, Ar/H, Fe/H,and Z. According to our model, the star formation\nefficiency is constant in time and space for r <= 6 kpc, but the SFR efficiency\ndecreases with time and galactocentric distance for r > 6 kpc. The reduction of\nthe SFR efficiency occurs earlier at higher r. While the galaxy follows the\ninside-out formation scenario for all r, the stars follow the inside-out\nscenario only up to r = 6 kpc, but for r > 6 kpc the stars follow an outside-in\nformation. The stellar formation histories inferred for each r imply that the\naverage age of the stars for r > 6 increases with r.</td>

      <td>Origin and growth of nuclear star clusters around massive black holes</td>
      <td>The centers of stellar spheroids are often marked by the presence of\nnucleated central regions, called nuclear star clusters (NSCs). The origin of\nNSCs is still unclear. Here we investigate the possibility that NSCs originate\nfrom the migration and merger of stellar clusters at the center of galaxies\nwhere a massive black hole (MBH) may sit. We show that the observed relation\nbetween NSC masses and the velocity dispersion of their host spheroids cannot\nbe reconciled with a purely in-situ formation scenario. On the other hand, the\nobserved relation appears to be in agreement with the predictions of the\ncluster merger model which also reproduces the observed relation between the\nsize of NSCs and their total luminosity. We evolve through dynamical friction a\npopulation of stellar clusters in a model of a galactic bulge taking into\naccount dynamical dissolution, starting from a power-law cluster initial mass\nfunction and a total mass in stellar clusters consistent with the cluster\nformation efficiency of the Milky Way (MW). The most massive clusters reach the\ncenter of the galaxy and merge to form a compact nucleus; after 10 Gyr, the\nresulting NSC has properties that are consistent with the observed distribution\nof stars in the MW NSC. When a MBH is included at the center of a galaxy,\nglobular clusters are tidally disrupted during inspiral, resulting in NSCs with\nlower densities than those of NSCs forming in galaxies with no MBHs. We suggest\nthis as a possible explanation for the lack of NSCs in galaxies containing MBHs\nmore massive than ~10^8M_Sun. Finally, we investigate the orbital evolution of\nglobular clusters in giant elliptical galaxies which are believed to always\nhost a MBH at their center rather than a NSC. In these systems an additional\nmechanism can prevent a NSC from forming: the time for globular clusters to\nreach the center of the galaxy is much longer than the Hubble time.</td>

      <td>Systematic investigation of the expected gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries in the pulsar timing band</td>
      <td>In this letter we carry out the first systematic investigation of the\nexpected gravitational wave (GW) background generated by supermassive black\nhole (SMBH) binaries in the nHz frequency band accessible to pulsar timing\narrays (PTAs). We take from the literature several estimates of the redshift\ndependent galaxy mass function and of the fraction of close galaxy pairs to\nderive a wide range of galaxy merger rates. We then exploit empirical black\nhole-host relations to populate merging galaxies with SMBHs. The result of our\nprocedure is a collection of a large number of phenomenological SMBH binary\nmerger rates consistent with current observational constraints on the galaxy\nassembly at z<1.5. For each merger rate we compute the associated GW signal,\neventually producing a large set of estimates of the nHz GW background that we\nuse to infer confidence intervals of its expected amplitude. When considering\nthe most recent SMBH-host relations, accounting for ultra-massive black holes\nin brightest cluster galaxies, we find that the nominal $1\sigma$ interval of\nthe expected GW signal is only a factor of 3-to-10 below current PTA limits,\nimplying a non negligible chance of detection in the next few years.</td>

We briefly discuss a number of science cases\nthat aim at studying the chemo-dynamical history of the major Galactic\ncomponents (bulge, thin and thick disks, and halo) - either as a follow-up to\nthe Gaia mission or on their own merits. Based on a large grid of synthetic\nspectra that cover the full range in stellar parameters of typical survey\ntargets, we devise an optimal wavelength range and argue for a moderately\nhigh-resolution spectrograph. As a result, the kinematic precision is not\nlimited by any of these factors, but will practically only suffer from\nsystematic effects, easily reaching uncertainties <1 km/s. Under realistic\nsurvey conditions (namely, considering stars brighter than r=16 mag with\nreasonable exposure times) we prefer an ideal resolving power of R~20000 on\naverage, for an overall wavelength range (with a common two-arm spectrograph\ndesign) of [395;456.5] nm and [587;673] nm. We show for the first time on a\ngeneral basis that it is possible to measure chemical abundance ratios to\nbetter than 0.1 dex for many species (Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Na, Al, V, Cr, Mn,\nCo, Ni, Y, Ba, Nd, Eu) and to an accuracy of about 0.2 dex for other species\nsuch as Zr, La, and Sr. While our feasibility study was explicitly carried out\nfor the 4MOST facility, the results can be readily applied to and used for any\nother conceptual design study for high-resolution spectrographs.</td>

Using a maximum\nlikelihood analysis, we determine the velocity dispersion profiles in spherical\ncoordinates ($\sigma_{r}$, $\sigma_{\theta}$, $\sigma_{\phi}$) and the\nanisotropy profile ($\beta$). The radial velocity dispersion profile\n($\sigma_{r}$) is measured out to a galactocentric radius of $r \sim 60$ kpc,\nbut due to the lack of proper-motion information, $\sigma_{\theta}$,\n$\sigma_{\phi}$ and $\beta$ could only be derived directly out to $r \sim25$\nkpc. From a starting value of $\beta\approx 0.5$ in the inner parts\n($9<r/\kpc<12$), the profile falls sharply in the range $r \approx 13-18$ kpc,\nwith a minimum value of $\beta=-1.2$ at $r=17$ kpc, rising sharply at larger\nradius. In the outer parts, in the range $25<r/\kpc<56$, we predict the profile\nto be roughly constant with a value of $\beta\approx 0.5$. The newly discovered\nkinematic anomalies are shown not to arise from halo substructures. We also\nstudied the anisotropy profile of simulated stellar halos formed purely by\naccretion and found that they cannot reproduce the sharp dip seen in the data.\nFrom the Jeans equation, we compute the stellar rotation curve ($v_{\rm circ}$)\nof the Galaxy out to $r \sim 25$ kpc. The mass of the Galaxy within $r \lesssim\n25$ kpc is determined to be $2.1 \times 10^{11}$ $M_{\sun}$, and with a\n3-component fit to $v_{\rm circ}(r)$, we determine the virial mass of the Milky\nWay dark matter halo to be $M_{\rm vir} = 0.9 ^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \times 10^{12}$\n$M_{\sun}$ ($R_{\rm vir} = 249^{+34}_{-31}$ kpc).</td>

      <td>Cosmic bulk flows on 50 {h}^{-1}Mpc scales: A Bayesian hyper-parameter method and multishells likelihood analysis</td>
      <td>It has been argued recently that the galaxy peculiar velocity field provides\nevidence of excessive power on scales of $50\hmpc$, which seems to be\ninconsistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. We discuss\nseveral assumptions and conventions used in studies of the large-scale bulk\nflow to check whether this claim is robust under a variety of conditions.\nRather than using a composite catalogue we select samples from the SN, ENEAR,\nSFI++ and A1SN catalogues, and correct for Malmquist bias in each according to\nthe IRAS PSCz density field. We also use slightly different assumptions about\nthe small-scale velocity dispersion and the parameterisation of the matter\npower spectrum when calculating the variance of the bulk flow. By combining the\nlikelihood of individual catalogues using a Bayesian hyper-parameter method, we\nfind that the joint likelihood of the amplitude parameter gives\n$\sigma_8=0.65^{+0.47}_{-0.35}(\pm 1 \sigma)$, which is entirely consistent\nwith the $\Lambda$CDM model. In addition, the bulk flow magnitude ($v \sim 310\n\kms$) and direction, $(l,b)\sim (280^{\circ} \pm 8^{\circ}, 5.1^{\circ} \pm\n6^{\circ})$, found by each of the catalogues are all consistent with each\nother, and with the bulk flow results from most previous studies. Furthermore,\nthe bulk flow velocities in different shells of the surveys constrain\n$\sigma_{8}$--$\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ to be\n($1.01^{+0.26}_{-0.20},0.31^{+0.28}_{-0.14}$, SFI++) and\n($1.04^{+0.32}_{-0.24},0.28^{+0.30}_{-0.14}$, ENEAR), which is consistent with\n{\it WMAP} 7-year best-fit values.

      <td>Flattened velocity dispersion profiles in Globular Clusters: Newtonian tides or modified gravity?</td>
      <td>Over the past couple of years, a number of observational studies have\nconfirmed the flattening of the radial velocity dispersion profiles for stars\nin various nearby globular clusters. As the projected radial coordinate is\nincreased, a radius appears beyond which, the measured velocity dispersion\nceases to drop and settles at a fixed value, $\sigma_{\infty}$. Under Newtonian\ngravity, this is explained by invoking tidal heating from the overall Milky Way\npotential on the outer, more loosely bound stars, of the globular clusters in\nquestion. From the point of view of modified gravity theories, such an outer\nflattening is expected on crossing the critical acceleration threshold $a_{0}$,\nbeyond which, a transition to MONDian dynamics is expected, were equilibrium\nvelocities cease to be a function of distance. In this paper we attempt to sort\nout between the above competing explanations, by looking at their plausibility\nin terms of an strictly empirical approach. We determine Newtonian tidal radii\nusing masses accurately calculated through stellar population modelling, and\nhence independent of any dynamical assumptions, distances, size and orbital\ndeterminations for a sample of 16 globular clusters. We show that their\nNewtonian tidal radii at perigalacticon are generally larger that the radii at\nwhich the flattening in the velocity dispersion profiles occurs, by large\nfactors of 4, on average. While this point makes the Newtonian tidal\nexplanation suspect, it is found that the radii at which the flattening is\nobserved on average correlate with the radii where the $a_{0}$ threshold is\ncrossed, and that $\sigma_{\infty}$ values scale with the fourth root of the\ntotal masses, all features predicted under modified gravity theories.</td>

We also\npresent new theoretical derivations of the {\Sigma} - D relation based on\nequipartition or on constant ratio between cosmic rays and magnetic field\nenergy. A new calibration sample of 60 Galactic SNRs with independently\ndetermined distances is created. Instead of (standard) vertical regression,\nused in previous papers, different fitting procedures are applied to the\ncalibration sample in the log {\Sigma} - log D plane. Non-standard regressions\nare used to satisfy the requirement that values of parameters obtained from the\nfitting of {\Sigma} - D and D - {\Sigma} relations should be invariant within\nestimated uncertainties. We impose symmetry between {\Sigma} - D and D -\n{\Sigma} due to the existence of large scatter in both D and {\Sigma}. Using\nfour fitting methods which treat {\Sigma} and D symmetrically, different\n{\Sigma} - D slopes {\beta} are obtained for the calibration sample. Monte\nCarlo simulations verify that the slopes of the empirical {\Sigma} - D relation\nshould be determined by using orthogonal regression, because of its good\nperformance for data sets with severe scatter. The slope derived here ({\beta}\n= 4.8) is significantly steeper than those derived in previous studies. This\nnew slope is closer to the updated theoretically predicted surface\nbrightness-diameter slope in the radio range for the Sedov phase. We also\nanalyze the empirical {\Sigma} - D relations for SNRs in the dense environment\nof molecular clouds and for SNRs evolving in lower-density interstellar medium.\nApplying the new empirical relation to estimate distances of Galactic SNRs\nresults in a dramatically changed distance scale.</td>

      <td>We study the observational constraints on the cosmic evolution of the\nrelationships between the massive black hole (MBH) mass (M_bh) and the stellar\nmass (M^*_sph; or velocity dispersion \sigma) of the host galaxy/spheroid.\nAssuming that the M_bh-M^*_sph (or M_bh-\sigma) relation evolves with redshift\nas \propto (1+z)^\Gamma, the MBH mass density can be obtained from either the\nobservationally determined galaxy stellar mass functions or velocity dispersion\ndistribution functions over redshift z~0-1.2 for any given \Gamma. The MBH mass\ndensity at different redshifts can also be inferred from the luminosity\nfunction of QSOs/AGNs provided known radiative efficiency \epsilon. By matching\nthe MBH density inferred from galaxies to that obtained from QSOs/AGNs, we find\nthat \Gamma=0.64^{+0.27}_{-0.29} for the M_bh-M^*_sph relation and\n\Gamma=-0.21^{+0.28}_{-0.33} for the M_bh-\sigma relation, and\n\epsilon=0.11^{+0.04}_{-0.03}. Our results suggest that the MBH mass growth\nprecedes the bulge mass growth but the galaxy velocity dispersion does not\nincrease with the mass growth of the bulge after the quench of nuclear\nactivity, which is roughly consistent with the two-phase galaxy formation\nscenario proposed by Oser et al. (2012) in which a galaxy roughly double its\nmasses after z=1 due to accretion and minor mergers while its velocity\ndispersion drops slightly.</td>

      <td>The first generation of large-scale chemical tagging surveys, in particular\nthe HERMES/GALAH million star survey, promises to vastly expand our\nunderstanding of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galaxy. This,\nhowever, is contingent on our ability to confidently perform chemical tagging\non such a large data-set. Chemical homogeneity has been observed across a range\nof elements within several Galactic open clusters, yet the level to which this\nis the case globally, and particularly in comparison to the scatter across\nclusters themselves, is not well understood. The patterns of elements in coeval\ncluster members, occupying a complex chemical abundance space, are rooted in\nthe evolution, ultimately the nature of the very late stages, of early\ngenerations of stars. The current astrophysical models of such stages are not\nyet sufficient to explain all observations, combining with our significant gaps\nin the understanding of star formation, makes this a difficult arena to tackle\ntheoretically. Here, we describe a robust pair-wise metric used to gauge the\nchemical difference between two stellar components. This metric is then applied\nto a database of high-resolution literature abundance sources to derive a\nfunction describing the probability that two stars are of common evolutionary\norigin. With this cluster probability function, it will be possible to report a\nconfidence, grounded in empirical observational evidence, with which clusters\nare detected, independent of the group finding methods. This formulation is\nalso used to probe the role of chemical dimensionality, and that of individual\nchemical species, on the ability of chemical tagging to differentiate coeval\ngroups of stars.</td>

Using the large sample of dwarf stars with proper motions and\nspectroscopically determined stellar parameters, metallicity gradients in the\nradial direction for various heights above the Galactic plane and in the\nvertical direction for various radial distances from the Galaxy center have\nbeen found. In particular, we find a vertical metallicity gradient of -0.113\n+/- 0.010 (-0.125 +/- 0.008) dex/kpc using an isochrone (photometric) distance\ndetermination in the range 1 < |Z| < 3 kpc, which is the vertical height range\nmost consistent with the thick disk of our Galaxy. In the radial direction, we\nfind metallicity gradients between +0.02 and +0.03 dex/kpc for bins in the\nvertical direction between 1 < |Z| < 3 kpc. Both of these results agree with\nsimilar values determined from other populations of stars, but this is the\nfirst time a radial metallicity gradient for the thick disk has been found at\nthese vertical heights. We are also able to separate thin and thick disk stars\nbased on kinematic and spatial probabilities in the vertical height range where\nthere is significant overlap of these two populations. This should aid further\nstudies of the metallicity gradients of the disk for vertical heights lower\nthan those studied here but above the solar neighborhood.

This stellar sample is significantly larger in both\nnumber and volume than previous spectroscopic analyses, which were limited to\nthe solar vicinity, making it ideal for comparison with local volume-limited\nsamples and Galactic models. For the first time, we have corrected the MDF for\nthe various observational biases introduced by the SEGUE target selection\nstrategy. The SEGUE sample is particularly notable for K dwarfs, which are too\nfaint to examine spectroscopically far from the solar neighborhood. The MDF of\nboth spectral types becomes more metal-poor with increasing |Z|, which reflects\nthe transition from a sample with small [alpha/Fe] values at small heights to\none with enhanced [alpha/Fe] above 1 kpc. Comparison of our SEGUE distributions\nto those of two different Milky Way models reveals that both are more\nmetal-rich than our observed distributions at all heights above the plane.

We perform spectral fits of\nthis Chandra observed flare, and compare our results to the two brightest\nflares ever observed with XMM-Newton. We find good agreement among the fitted\nspectral slopes (Gamma~2) and X-ray absorbing columns (N_H~15X10^{22} cm^{-2})\nfor all three of these events, resolving prior differences (which are most\nlikely due to the combined effects of pileup and spectral modeling) among\nChandra and XMM-Newton observations of Sgr A* flares. We also discuss fits to\nthe quiescent spectra of Sgr A*.</td>

      <td>The inhomogenous reionization of the inter-galactic medium by metal-poor globular clusters</td>
      <td>We present detailed radiative transfer simulations of the reionization\nhistory of the Milky Way by metal-poor globular clusters. We identify potential\nmetal-poor globular cluster candidates within the Aquarius simulation using\ndark matter halo velocity dispersions. We calculate the local ionization fields\nvia a photon-conserving, three dimensional non-equilibrium chemistry code and\nallow the model to propagate through to the present day. The key feature of the\nmodel is that globular cluster formation is suppressed if the local gas is\nionized.\n  We find that our spatial treatment of the ionization field leads to\ndrastically different numbers and spatial distributions when compared to models\nwhere globular cluster formation is simply truncated at a given redshift. We\nfind that it is possible for metal-poor globular clusters to have formed via\nthe dark matter halo formation channel as our secondary model (delayed\nformation) combined with truncation at z = 10 produces radial distributions\nstatistically consistent with that of the Milky Way metal-poor globular\nclusters.\n  If globular clusters do indeed form within high-redshift dark matter halos,\nif only in-part, their contributions to the reionization of the local (i.e. 2^3\nh^-3 Mpc^3 centred on the host galaxy) volume and mass by redshift 10 could be\nas high as 98% and 90%, respectively. In our photon poorest model, this\ncontribution drops to 60% and 50%. The surviving clusters in all models have a\nnarrow average age range (mean = 13.34 Gyr, \sigma = 0.04 Gyr) consistent with\ncurrent ages estimates of the Milky Way metal-poor globular clusters.\n  We also test a simple dynamical destruction model and estimate that ~60% of\nall metal-poor globular clusters formed at high redshift have since been\ndestroyed via tidal interactions with the host galaxy.</td>

      <td>Photometric distances to young stars in the inner galactic disk</td>
      <td>We present results of the first extensive and deep CCD photometric survey\ncarried out in the field of the open cluster Trumpler 27, an object in the\nconstellation of Sagittarius not far from the Galaxy center.\n  We look for young stars clumps that might plausibly be associated with spiral\nstructure. Wide-field UBVI photometry combined with infrared information allows\nus to reconstruct the distribution in reddening and distance of young stars in\nthe field using the Color-Color and Color-Magnitude diagrams.\n  The analysis of our data, combined too with extensive spectroscopy taken from\nliterature shows that the real entity of Trumpler 27 as an open cluster is far\nfrom being firmly stated. In fact, instead of finding a relatively compact\ngroup of stars confined to a small distance range, we found that stars\nassociated to Trumpler 27 are, indeed, a superposition of early type stars seen\nalong the line of sight extending over several kiloparsecs beyond even the\ncenter of the galaxy. We demonstrate that at each distance range it becomes\npossible to generate a color-magnitude diagram resembling that of an open\ncluster. This way, our analysis indicates that what was considered an open\ncluster characterized by a significant age spread is a stellar continuum that\nreaches its maximum number of stars at approximately 3.5 kpc from the Sun, the\ndistance of the Scutum-Crux arm approximately. At the same time, and after\nanalyzing the way early type stars distribute with distance, we found some of\nthese stellar groups may be linked, within the distance errors, with other\ninner spiral arms of our galaxy, including the Near 3 kpc arm at approximately\n5 kpc from the Sun. However, very young stars by themselves do not seem to\ntrace strongly the inner spiral arms since they are distributed evenly across\nseveral kiloparsecs toward the center of the Galaxy.</td>

      <td>Eccentric disc instability in stellar discs formed from inspiraling gas clouds in the Galactic Centre</td>
      <td>The inspiral of a turbulent molecular cloud in the Galactic Centre may result\nin the formation of a small, dense and moderately eccentric gas disc around the\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH). Such a disc is unstable to fragmentation and\nmay lead to the formation of young massive stars in the central parsec of the\nGalaxy. Here we perform high-accuracy direct summation N-body simulations of a\nring of massive stars (with initial semi-major axes 0.1 < a/pc < 0.4 and\neccentricities 0.2 < e < 0.4), subject to the potential of the SMBH, a stellar\ncusp, and the parent gas disc, to study how the orbital elements of the ring\nevolve in time. The initial conditions for the stellar ring are drawn from the\nresults of previous simulations of molecular cloud infall and disruption in the\nSMBH potential. While semi-major axes do not evolve significantly, the\ndistribution of eccentricities spreads out very fast (~1 Myr) as a consequence\nof cusp precession. In particular, stellar orbits with initial eccentricity\ne>0.3 (e<0.3) tend to become even more (less) eccentric, resulting in a bimodal\neccentricity distribution. The distribution is qualitatively consistent with\nthat of the massive stars observed in the Galactic Centre's clockwise disc.</td>

      <td>Constraints on the Shape of the Milky Way Dark Matter Halo from Jeans Equations Applied to SDSS Data</td>
      <td>We search for evidence of dark matter in the Milky Way by utilizing the\nstellar number density distribution and kinematics measured by the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) to heliocentric distances exceeding ~10 kpc. We\nemploy the cylindrically symmetric form of Jeans equations and focus on the\nmorphology of the resulting acceleration maps, rather than the normalization of\nthe total mass as done in previous, mostly local, studies. Jeans equations are\nfirst applied to a mock catalog based on a cosmologically derived N-body + SPH\nsimulation, and the known acceleration (gradient of gravitational potential) is\nsuccessfully recovered. The same simulation is also used to quantify the impact\nof dark matter on the total acceleration. We use Galfast, a code designed to\nquantitatively reproduce SDSS measurements and selection effects, to generate a\nsynthetic stellar catalog. We apply Jeans equations to this catalog and produce\ntwo-dimensional maps of stellar acceleration. These maps reveal that in a\nNewtonian framework, the implied gravitational potential cannot be explained by\nvisible matter alone. The acceleration experienced by stars at galactocentric\ndistances of ~20 kpc is three times larger than what can be explained by purely\nvisible matter. The application of an analytic method for estimating the dark\nmatter halo axis ratio to SDSS data implies an oblate halo with q_DM = 0.47 +/-\n0.14 within the same distance range. These techniques can be used to map the\ndark matter halo to much larger distances from the Galactic center using\nupcoming deep optical surveys, such as LSST.</td>

      <td>The dark matter halos of dwarf galaxies: a challenge for the LCDM paradigm?</td>
      <td>The cold dark matter halo mass function is much steeper than the galaxy\nstellar mass function on galactic and subgalactic scales. This difference is\nusually reconciled by assuming that the galaxy formation efficiency drops\nsharply with decreasing halo mass, so that virtually no dwarf galaxies form in\nhalos less massive than ~ 10^10 M_sun. In turn, this implies that, at any given\nradius, the dark mass enclosed by a galaxy must exceed a certain minimum. We\nuse rotation curves of dwarf galaxies compiled from the literature to explore\nwhether their enclosed mass is consistent with these constraints. We find that\nalmost one half of the dwarfs in our sample with stellar mass between 10^6-10^7\nM_sun are at odds with this restriction: either they live in halos with masses\nsubstantially below 10^10 M_sun or there is a mechanism capable of reducing the\ndark mass enclosed by some of the faintest dwarfs. Neither possibility is\neasily accommodated within the standard LCDM scenario. Extending galaxy\nformation to halos well below 10^10 M_sun would lead to large numbers of dwarf\ngalaxies in excess of current estimates; at the same time, the extremely low\nstellar mass of the systems involved makes it unlikely that baryonic effects\ncan reduce their dark matter content. Resolving this challenge seems to require\nnew insights into dwarf galaxy formation, or perhaps a radical revision of the\nprevailing paradigm.</td>

      <td>A statistical method for measuring the Galactic potential and testing gravity with cold tidal streams</td>
      <td>We introduce the Minimum Entropy Method, a simple statistical technique for\nconstraining the Milky Way gravitational potential and simultaneously testing\ndifferent gravity theories directly from 6D phase-space surveys and without\nadopting dynamical models. We demonstrate that orbital energy distributions\nthat are separable (i.e. independent of position) have an associated entropy\nthat increases under wrong assumptions about the gravitational potential and/or\ngravity theory. Of known objects, `cold' tidal streams from low-mass\nprogenitors follow orbital distributions that most nearly satisfy the condition\nof separability. Although the orbits of tidally stripped stars are perturbed by\nthe progenitor's self-gravity, systematic variations of the energy distribution\ncan be quantified in terms of the cross-entropy of individual tails, giving\nfurther sensitivity to theoretical biases in the host potential. The\nfeasibility of using the Minimum Entropy Method to test a wide range of gravity\ntheories is illustrated by evolving restricted N-body models in a Newtonian\npotential and examining the changes in entropy introduced by Dirac, MONDian and\nf(R) gravity modifications.</td>
